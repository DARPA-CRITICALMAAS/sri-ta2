By 1930, the Maid of Texas vein had been discovered about 300 feet southeast of te Maid of Mexico vein and returned values ranging up to 0.92 opt gold (Grybeck and Berg, 1998, Roppel, 2001). There are no known underground workings on the Maid of Texas. Leo Haider along with partners Earl Ohmer and Tony Steele erected a 10 stamp mill on the property and produced small amounts of ore from the Maid of Mexico in 1931, 1933 and intermittently from 1934 to 1939.

2,Williams (1954) noted that the Alaska Territorial Department of Mines had seven confidential maps of the underground workings dating from 1933 to 1935. These maps indicated the presence of 130 feet of crosscut from the portal of the mine and 260 feet of drifting on the vein along with also several raises and winzes. Williams (1953) reported that in 1953 the property was under lease by Laurence Heiner and indicated that the workings were accessible but the winze was full of water at that time. The Maid of Mexico property was active in 1979 and the owners had cleaned out the drifts in anticipation of resuming production.

Additional gold discoveries were soon made at the Helen S, Maid of Mexico and Maid of Texas prospects to the north and northeast of the Hattie mine. In addition to gold, all of these vein occurrences contained variable amounts of Ag, Zn, Pb and Cu and were hosted in metavolcanic rocks (Grybeck and Berg, 1998).
 
 A 20 stamp mill was shipped to the Hattie prospect in 1902 but was never constructed at the property because of disappointing underground results (Roppel, 2001). Wright and Wright, (1908) reported that there were about 500 feet of underground workings accessed via an adit at the Hattie prospect. Roehm (1945) noted",0.008019162341952324
5,"Significant drill assays from the 11-hole Amselco 1986 drilling program are presented in Table 3. While drilling data available to the author are incomplete, the data that are available indicate similar elemental relationships as observed in the Brushy Creek prospect. Lost Lake Zn/Pd ratios vary widely from <5:1 to over 2,500:1 with the higher Zn/Pb ratios occurring in areas where lead values are extremely low. As lead values increase in an absolute sense, Zn/Pb ratios fall to levels generally less than 10:1. Silver values appear to be independent of lead and zinc values suggesting silver is contained in a separate mineralogical species. Copper and gold values do not appear to be correlative with lead, zinc or silver.

The property was inactive before World War II but has been repeatedly visited by prospectors and industry geologists over the last several decades. Details of this more recent work are not available.
 
 In May 1902 Charles Smith discovered gold and staked the Helen S claim about a half mile northwest of Harvey’s Lake (Figure 2, Roppel, 2001). This property s located on claims not currently owned or controlled by Olympic Resources or Bravo Venture Group. Olympic Mining erected the 20 stamp mill originally ordered for the Hattie prospect on the Helen S and began operations in 1904. The property was patented in 1904 and worked intermittently until at least 1915.",0.012231151573359966

Sampling conducted by Olympic Resources returned grab rock sample values up to 10.15 gpt gold from Harveys Creek prospect and 6.3 gpt gold from intrusive float north of the Brushy Creek prospect. McDonald and others (1998) reported gold values in grab rock samples up to 11.2 gpt gold from the Helen S prospect, 36.9 gpt gold from the Maid of Mexico and 2.8 gpt gold from the Hattie prospect.

Textures visible in outcrop include poly-phase hydrothermal breccia wherein sulfide-bearing clasts are surrounded by a sulfide-bearing matrix suggesting multiple phases of sulfidation during exhalative deposition. Airborne geophysical data confirm that the Brushy Creek prospect is situated in the middle of a 10 kilometer long conductive zone stretching from Mitkof Island on the east to Lung Island on the west (Figure 5).

Total production from the work conducted in the 1930’s is unknown.
 
 Little is published about the Harvey Creek property, a small quartz gold vein prospect on the trail between Harveys Lake and the coast (Figure 2). Roppel (2201) indicates that Leo Haider produced small amounts of gold from Harveys Creek vein using an arrastra mill constructed in the late 1920’s.

 The Lost Lake prospect occurs in a sequence of east-northeast striking andesite flows and breccias mapped by Karl and others (1999) as Late Triassic in age. Mineralization is associated with intermediate to felsic tuffs and tuff breccias and is enveloped by clay-silica alteration (Terry and Gibson, 1998). Carbonaceous sediments have been identified from higher in the stratigraphic sequence in several drill holes completed by Amselco. The mineralization consists of fine to medium-grained pale brown sphalerite with subordinate galena.

 Core drilling conducted by Olympic Resources in the Brushy Creek area in 2002 contains metasediments, metabasalts and extensive thicknesses of sericite —sulfide altered volcanic rocks.

Silver to gold ratios are highly variable and range from 5.1 to 684. Silver values appear to be closely linked to zinc and lead values but gold is less clearly associated with elevated base metal values.

Limited field evidence gathered by Olympic Resources suggests the mapped location of the Duncan Canal fault on Woewodski Island may be overly simplistic.
