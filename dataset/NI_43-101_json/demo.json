The Mount Rawdon mine includes the operating Mount Rawdon open pit mine, mill and tailings storage facility.", "\n \n Mount Rawdon is located in southeast Queensland, approximately 80 kilometers south-west of Bundaberg and 300 kilometers north North West of Brisbane. The mine site is serviced from the small township of Mount Perry, which is located 20 kilometers north of the mine.", "\n \n The Mount Rawdon Deposit is the only currently operating gold mine within the area. Canfield (1989) identified and mapped the rocks at Mt Rawdon on the Maryborough 1:250000 sheet as part of the Late Triassic Aranbanga Volcanic Group, which unconformably overlies rocks of the Curtis Island Group and is intruded by Permo-Triassic granitoids. The Aranbanga Volcanic Group lies within the Coastal Block, one of three major stratigraphic blocks recognised in the region. These blocks young eastward from the Carboniferous Coastal Block, to the Late Carboniferous Goodnight Block and the Permian Gympie Block.", "\n \n The local geology at Mt Rawdon is dominated by dacite intrusives and dacite-rich volcaniclastics. The two are considered genetically linked; and have been intruded by a sequence of acidic to basic dykes and plugs. While many of the rocks present at Mt Rawdon are peculiar to the Mt Rawdon Complex, other lithologies, such as the quartz trachyte dykes are regional in their extent.", "\n \n The mineralisation is considered synchronous to subsequent to most of the intrusive activity and all of the major rock types at the deposit are mineralised to some degree.", "\n \n Two major lineaments in the region are the east-north-east trending Swindon Fault zone and the north-north-west trending Perry Fault zone. The Coastal Block sediments have a layering and a foliation that reflects these trends.", "\n \n The Swindon Fault zone marks the contact between the Aranbanga Volcanic Group and the Curtis Island Group metasediments to the south. Regionally, the Perry Fault zone is a series of upright faults, which are aligned with the eastern margin of the Middle Triassic Esk Trough to the south. The dominant movement", "\n", "\n \n Mount Rawdon Mine Technical Report", "\n \n along these faults is suggested to be sinistral for the Perry Fault zone and dextral along the Swindon Fault zone.", "\n \n Multiple phases of volcanic and intrusive activity occurred during the Middle to Late Triassic. Cranfield identifies three main phases.", "\n \n The first at 235-230Ma includes granodiorite and diorite intrusives, followed by the eruption of olivine basalt, pyroxene andesites and rhyolitic ignimbrite of the Aranbanga Volcanic Group at 228-223 Ma. The final phase at 218-215 Ma is associated with cauldron collapse and ring fracturing, resurgent doming and subvolcanic felsic intrusions.", "\n \n Molybdenum, copper, copper-gold and epithermal gold mineralisation in the region are closely associated with Triassic magmatism (Cranfield, 1994).", "\n \n The Mount Rawdon gold deposit is a massive, volcaniclastic hosted, low grade gold deposit that exhibits excellent characteristics conducive to low cost mining and treatment. The surface extent of mineralisation forms a roughly ovoid zone of 200 meters x 300 meters at greater than 0.7g/t gold.", "\n \n The mineralisation takes the form of pyrite disseminations in the matrix of a volcaniclastic sequence and as sulphide veinlets. Gold grade generally increases as pyrite alteration and sulphide veining increase. The host volcaniclastic sequence strikes northeast and has a shallow to moderate dip to the southwest. The volcaniclastics are typically massive and poorly sorted.", "\n \n An intrusive dacitic dome feature with associated andesite and trachyandesite dykes occurs south of the main mineralised zone. The contact is steeply dipping and the margins are brecciated. Intrusion of dacitic fragmental rocks occur adjacent and at the intersection of north north-west striking and east-north-east striking structures which are parallel to the major regional Perry Fault (NNW strike) and Swindon Fault (ENE strike). These fragmentals occur at the North West contact of the main dacite body and are compositionally equivalent. The margins are steep dipping.", "\n \n A later stage of trachytic and acid-intermediate intrusion has resulted in a series of four quartz trachyte dykes that intrude the mineralised zone at Mt Rawdon. There are also other associated intrusives present.", "\n \n The mineralisation and alteration at Mt Rawdon postdate the volcaniclastic sequence and Dacite suite. It is still open at depth to the south west of the main zone and at the contact of the fragmental dacite plug with the main dacite body.", "\n \n The Mount Rawdon deposit provides feed for the mill, a modern carbon-in-leach (CIL) gold extraction plant with a 10,000 tonne per day capacity.", "\n", "\n \n Mount Rawdon Mine Technical Report", "\n \n LGL currently maintains six Exploration Permit for Minerals (EPM\u2019s), surrounding the Mount Rawdon mine site.

The deposit has produced 23.3 million tonnes of ore containing 0.793 million ounces of gold since February 2001. Production has shown that the current Mineral Reserve and Resource models are within a marginally acceptable tolerance of variance for both tonnage and grade of the deposit when compared to surveyed mine production.
