This portion of east-central Idaho lies within the Cordilleran fold and thrust belt, and in the Basin-and-Range structural and geo-physiographic province. Rocks types and structures throughout the region reflect a long and complex history of deformation. Strata were deposited here in the Mesoproterozoic Belt intracratonic rift basin, and episodically in the late Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic Cordilleran miogeocline.", "\n \n The Empire Project area overlies a north-trending contact zone between an Eocene granitic complex, including the Mackay Granite and Mackay Porphyry, and the Upper Mississippian age White Knob Limestone.

The 2018 drilling campaign was designed with three primary objectives: first, to target the inferred areas within the proposed pit boundary and improve understanding of mineralization in those areas; second, to target peripheral mineralization in the northern and eastern portions of the Project area outside of the pit; and third, to obtain a sufficient amount of core sample to be used for metallurgical test work.

First, broad geologic domains where created from drillhole data for five (5) geologic units; The Mackay Granite, limestone, a general grouping of skarns (magnetite, iron oxide breccia, pyroxene and garnet), granite porphyry, and overburden. Following the construction of these domains, an indicator estimation methodology was used to estimate the individual lithologies (granites, limestone, iron oxide breccia, magnetite skarn, pyroxene skarn, garnet skarn, granite porphyry, and latite dikes) into the general skarn and granite porphyry domains using an inverse distance to the power of 2.5 with a maximum distance of 300 ft.

The oxide (e.g. carbonates such as malachite and azurite) and sulfide (chalcopyrite/chalcocite) mineralization is developed to varying degrees within exoskarn in limestone and endoskarn in porphyry.

Although the location of the majority of the past metallurgical sampling is not well defined in the available metallurgical reports, it appears that the majority of the test work has been completed on material that is within 100 feet of surface. Future studies should be conducted on material collected at greater depth in order to evaluate the recovery relationship with depth and to develop a better understanding of the oxidation state of material in the deeper portions of the deposit.

Preliminary information indicates that the copper extraction reached the same mark at 25 days as the un-agglomerated material did at 50 days of leaching. This represents a 50% reduction in the leach duration time. It also appears that the long -term copper extraction rate and acid consumption rate will both be near to the un-agglomerated material column test results. In Figure 13-3, the extraction rate for data for the column with agglomerated grand composite material (CL-7) is shown to be approaching 76% after 34 days of leaching. Column CL-7 is still being leached at the time of this writing the extraction line indicates that there will be little additional copper extracted after 34 days.", "\n \n Based on the data obtained from column testing, it appears that the copper extraction rate and acid consumption rate is dependent on the ore type treated. The highest extraction rate and the highest acid consumption rate will be experienced when treating the exoskarn ore type. It also appears that leaching the material as separate ore types or as mixed material has no effect on the copper extraction rate or acid consumption rate of the leach system. With the tested leach conditions, there will be a copper extraction rate of 70% after 50 days leaching and a maximum (long term) copper extraction rate, as predicted by the bottle roll tests, of 76%. Test results indicate that the acid consumption will be 80 to 140 Ibs/ton rock, or a weighted average of 110 lbs/ton. Experience has shown that for many materials the amount of acid which will be consumed in an industrial-scale leach operation will typically be 20 to 50% of the amount consumed in a \u201cpulverized material\u201d bottle roll test.

HRC estimated the mineral resources for the Project based on drillhole data constrained by geologic boundaries with an Ordinary Krige (\u201cOK\u201d) algorithm. Leapfrog Geo Vs5.1.2 (\u201cLeapfrog\u201d) software was used to complete the resource estimate. The metals of interest at the Project are copper, zinc, gold and silver.
