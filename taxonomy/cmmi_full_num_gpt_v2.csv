0,0,Residual placer tin,"Residual placer tin deposits are also known as Lag tin. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Residual placer tin deposits include: Chemical weathering, erosion of soft material, and concentration of resistate minerals in situ, preexisting mineralization.  Residual placer tin deposits, or Lag tin deposits, are distinct due to their formation through prolonged chemical weathering and physical erosion, resulting in the in situ concentration of resistate minerals like cassiterite (SnO2). These deposits typically form in tropical and subtropical environments where erosional processes are prominent, and are generally associated with granitic bedrock or regions with preexisting tin mineralization. The host rocks are often weathered granite or its derivatives; however, they can also form over pegmatites and greisens, where cassiterite was originally deposited. The ore types predominantly include cassiterite, occasionally accompanied by accessory minerals such as wolframite or zircon. Although the grade of these deposits can vary, they often present lower tonnage compared to other placer deposits due to their residual nature. Physiographically, they occur in areas known for thick, lateritic soil profiles. The mineralization ages span a wide range but are frequently linked to recent geological periods where intense tropical weathering is ongoing. Orebodies are typically sheet-like and stretch parallel to the topographic surface, concentrated in the soil or weathered mantle. Alteration processes primarily involve kaolinization and limonitization, resulting from weathering effects. Ore controls are heavily reliant on the geochemistry of the weathering profile and the presence of cassiterite-rich bedrock. Structural controls may include gentle folding or faulting that enhances mineral concentration via weathering. Common tectonic settings for these deposits are stable cratonic regions or ancient orogenic belts that facilitate prolonged stable conditions required for intense weathering. This residual form differentiates these deposits from alluvial placers, which are transported and re-deposited by water, as well as from primary tin deposits, where there is minimal modification from weathering and erosion processes."
1,1,Residual placer lead,"Residual placer lead deposits are also known as Lag lead. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Residual placer lead deposits include: Chemical weathering, erosion of soft material, and concentration of resistate minerals in situ, preexisting mineralization.  Residual placer lead deposits, also known as lag lead, are a subset of placer deposits characterized by the in situ concentration of resistate minerals following the chemical weathering and erosion of softer surrounding material. These deposits primarily form in environments where pre-existing lead-bearing mineralization has undergone intense weathering and mechanical erosion, leaving behind heavy and resistant minerals like galena. Unlike typical alluvial placer deposits which are relocated by water action, residual placers remain near their source, thereby maintaining a close genetic relationship with the bedrock mineralization. The host rock types are often residual soils or regolith developed over igneous or metamorphic terrains that previously contained significant lead mineralization. Commodity types primarily include lead, with galena being the predominant ore mineral, often accompanied by secondary minerals such as cerussite or anglesite resulting from further weathering. The grades of these deposits can be variable, heavily influenced by the extent of weathering and leaching processes; however, they can be significant due to the concentrated nature of the resistate lead minerals. Physiographically, these deposits are typically found on gentle slopes or upland surfaces where mechanical erosion is minimized, allowing for prolonged weathering conditions. The mineralization age can vary widely, as it is contingent upon both the age of the primary mineralization and the onset of weathering processes. Orebodies are generally irregular, reflecting the uneven nature of weathering and erosion processes, with little to no significant alteration processes beyond secondary weathering. Structural controls are minimal since the deposits are residual and not structurally remobilized, but the original mineralization could be structurally controlled. Tectonic settings are less influential for residual placer deposits, as their formation is fundamentally linked to surface processes postdating earlier tectonic activity. These distinguishing features emphasize the unique formation mechanisms and localization of residual placer lead deposits compared to transported placer or primary lead deposits."
2,2,Fluvial placer gold,"Fluvial placer gold deposits are also known as Alluvial gold. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer gold deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization. Fluvial placer gold type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39a. Fluvial placer gold type mineral deposits are also known as Placer Au-PGE.  Fluvial placer gold deposits, also referred to as alluvial gold deposits or USGS deposit model 39a, are primarily found in high-energy alluvial settings and are synonymous with Cenozoic aged deposits. These deposits commonly occur in river environments where currents decelerate, facilitating the deposition of heavy minerals like gold. Positioned in association with alluvial gravels and conglomerates, particularly those with white quartz clasts, these deposits frequently occur in locations such as the inside bends of meanders, beneath overlying boulders, or within vegetative mats. The high-energy settings required for their formation are typically linked with areas where river gradients reduce significantly, such as below rapids. Tectonically, they are often found along major fault zones and shield areas that have experienced significant erosion, leading to multicycle sedimentation, including high-level terrace gravels. Mineralogically, gold often coexists with platinum-iron alloys, quartz, magnetite, and ilmenite. The signature flattened, rounded edges or flaky textures of the gold particles—ranging from flour-like fine grains to occasional larger nuggets—distinguish these deposits. Gold concentration is largely governed by natural ""traps"" such as streambed riffles or structures like fracturing bedrock or transverse trending formations that hinder particle movement, often congregating above impermeable clay layers. Geochemically, these deposits contain elevated levels of silver, arsenic, mercury, among other elements. Their formation through dynamic erosional processes—the winnowing action of water—sets them apart from other placer deposits like beach or glacial placers. The grades and tonnage vary but correlate positively with both silver content and proximity to source deposits, primarily due to their unique depositional and geomorphological features that contribute to their differentiation from other placer gold deposit types."
3,3,Fluvial placer PGE,"Fluvial placer PGE deposits are also known as Alluvial PGE. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer PGE deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization. Fluvial placer PGE type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39b. Fluvial placer PGE type mineral deposits are also known as Placer PGE-Au.  Fluvial placer PGE (Platinum Group Elements) deposits, also referred to as Alluvial PGE or Placer PGE-Au, are distinctive due to their geological, mineralogical, and depositional features, setting them apart from other mineral deposit types. These deposits primarily form in erosional environments and are composed of alluvial gravels and conglomerates, with an assemblage of heavy minerals indicative of ultramafic sources. They typically manifest in fluvial systems, ranging from medium to low gradient rivers and streams, and are deposited across diverse settings, including marine and desert environments. The age of mineralization for such deposits spans from the Tertiary to Holocene, though preservation of older deposits is uncommon. Structurally, these deposits align with Paleozoic to Mesozoic accreted terranes and are often found along major fault zones and high-level terrace gravels, reflecting their affiliation with tectonically active settings. The mineralogical composition includes platinum-iron alloys such as isoferroplatinum, ferroanplatinum, and others, along with Au, Ir, and Os-Ir alloys and base metal minerals like magnetite, chromite, and ilmenite. These minerals usually exhibit coarse to fine textures, regularly exhibiting flattened and rounded morphologies. Ore controls are defined by natural trap sites such as fractured bedrock and clayey beds within the gravels, concentrating PGEs and associated elements in zones that facilitate mechanical sorting. The deposits present a notable geochemical signature, marked by high levels of Ag, As, Hg, Sb, Cu, Fe, S, and Cr. Grade correlations show a significant relationship between PGE content and other elements such as gold, osmium, iridium, and palladium. Fluvial placer PGE deposits are particularly distinguished by their unique origins from ultramafic erosion, specific ore control by fluvial dynamics, and settings associated with significant tectonic structures, exemplified by locations like the Urals and Goodnews Bay District."
4,4,Fluvial placer tin,"Fluvial placer tin deposits are also known as Alluvial tin. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer tin deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization. Fluvial placer tin type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39e. Fluvial placer tin type mineral deposits are also known as Alluvial placer Sn.  Fluvial placer tin deposits, also known as alluvial tin or USGS deposit model number 39e, are distinctive due to their formation in erosional environments along modern and fossil streambeds where the hydraulic concentration of cassiterite, the primary ore mineral, occurs. These deposits are largely composed of alluvial sand, gravel, and conglomerate, typically situated near lode tin sources, with cassiterite accompanied by heavy minerals like magnetite, ilmenite, and zircon. The grade and tonnage of these deposits do not directly correlate with their source lode deposits; instead, the richest placer deposits are often found in proximities to the primary source, within streams running parallel to tin-bearing granites. Cassiterite grains in alluvial deposits become coarser as one approaches the source, oftentimes forming in natural traps such as potholes and riffles within the streambed. The mineralization age of fluvial placer tin deposits varies widely, ranging from the late Tertiary to Holocene, though formation can occur at any geologic age. These deposits typically occur in stable tectonic settings, characterized by Paleozoic to Cenozoic accreted terranes or stable cratonic fold belts with evolved granitoid plutons. Notably, the geochemical signature of fluvial placer tin deposits includes anomalous concentrations of elements such as Sn, As, B, F, W, Be, Cu, Pb, and Zn. A key distinguishing feature of fluvial placer tin deposits is their formation in specific erosional settings strongly influenced by the dynamics of water flow, setting them apart from other in situ or tectonically disturbed tin deposit types. Their preservation within tectonically stable environments allows these deposits to serve as important indicators of past erosional and depositional processes, offering insights into the paleo-geological and climatic histories of the regions they inhabit."
5,5,Fluvial placer niobium-tantalum,"Fluvial placer niobium-tantalum deposits are also known as Alluvial niobium-tantalum. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer niobium-tantalum deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization.  Fluvial placer niobium-tantalum deposits, often termed alluvial deposits, are distinctive secondary mineral deposits predominantly located in sedimentary environments where erosion plays a crucial role. The primary ore minerals in these deposits are columbite-tantalite, which serve as key sources for both niobium and tantalum. These ores typically settle in unconsolidated sediments such as sands and gravels, transported by rivers and deposited in beds within river terraces or alluvial plains, making them suitable for placer mining. Accompanying heavy minerals may include tin and trace elements. Economically viable operation often requires the presence of high-grade concentrations, with the overall tonnage contingent on factors such as the alluvium's size and the maturity of the drainage system. Geographically, they are situated in regions displaying considerable topographic relief, often influenced by significant exhumation or uplift, which fosters the development of extensive drainage networks. These settings enhance the mechanical weathering processes, pivotal in ore concentration. The deposits themselves do not typically exhibit chemical alteration seen in lode deposits; instead, they reflect the processes of physical wear. Ore control is dictated by hydrodynamic sorting and the specific geological features of the drainage basin. Significantly, these deposits are linked to regions undergoing tectonic uplift and erosion, usually involving primary source rocks such as granitic or pegmatitic bodies. Age-wise, they align with the timeframe of erosional and sedimentary processes rather than with primary mineralization. This secondary nature, characterized by the transportation and deposition of materials via river activity, distinctly separates them from primary mineral deposits which form in situ."
6,6,Fluvial placer tungsten,"Fluvial placer tungsten deposits are also known as Alluvial tungsten. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer tungsten deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization.  Fluvial placer tungsten deposits, such as those at Alder Gulch, Alaska, exhibit unique characteristics that distinguish them from other mineral deposit types. The geological setting features resistant monzonitic intrusives encircled by a thermally altered aureole within sedimentary rocks of the Kuskokwim Group. These include phyllitic siltstone, mudstone, and conglomerates, which are the products of late Early to Late Cretaceous periods, with K-Ar dating giving an age of approximately 69 million years for biotite from the intrusive rocks. The placer deposits primarily contain tungsten (scheelite - calcium tungstate) and gold, associated with heavy minerals. A notable 2.5% tungsten content is found in the concentrate, alongside anomalous lead, silver, and niobium. The terrain is described as accordant rounded ridges with broad sediment-filled lowlands and maturely dissected uplands. Within this physiography, the perennial stream of Alder Gulch indicates a classic fluvial environment facilitating the distribution of minerals. Orebodies are typically hosted along shear zones at contacts between monzonitic intrusives and hornfelsed sedimentary rocks, characterized by quartz-tourmaline vein rubble. Alteration processes include tourmaline enrichment and hornfelsing, driven by intrusive events. Ore genesis is influenced by the exhumation and erosion of faulted and mineralized contacts, where structures such as shearing and air-photo identified lineaments indicate significant geological movement. Situated on the eastern edge of the Kuskokwim Mountains, the region reflects tectonic settings marked by shear deformation and hydrothermal activity associated with intrusive processes. The distinguishing feature of this deposit type is the interplay of residual, semi-residual, and classic alluvial processes, with mineral migration primarily detected in the colluvial-alluvial zones. This combination of geological, structural, and physiographic factors imparts a distinct identity to fluvial placer tungsten deposits compared to other placer and lode forms."

Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer REE deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, specific rock types.  Fluvial placer Rare Earth Element (REE) deposits, also known as Alluvial REE deposits, are an intriguing subtype of placer deposits. These deposits primarily form through the mechanical concentration of REEs in riverine environments, making them distinct due to their genesis and setting. Characteristic rock types associated with these deposits often include granitic and alkaline rocks, as well as carbonatites, due to their typically high REE content. The commodity types in these deposits predominantly include monazite, xenotime, and sometimes bastnäsite, which are significant sources of REEs. Physically, they are found in river channels, floodplains, and alluvial fans, indicating an erosional environment driven by dynamic fluvial systems. The grade of these deposits can vary significantly but they are generally lower grade compared to primary REE deposits; however, their surface accessibility and ease of extraction often compensate for this. Tonnage can vary widely, dependent on the size and concentration of the sedimentary basin. These deposits are typically young, frequently Cenozoic in age, reflecting recent weathering and erosional processes. Ore bodies are often lens-shaped or stratified layers within the sedimentary sequence, showing minimal alteration due to the non-reactive fluvial environment. Ore control is primarily sedimentological, influenced by variations in flow energy and sediment size, with the heavy REE-rich minerals settling in areas of lower energy. Structurally, these deposits do not rely on complex tectonic settings, but rather on stable cratonic regions or adjacent to areas of uplift that provide a continuous supply of sediment. The tectonic setting is usually passive margins or intraplate settings with extensive weathering profiles that liberate REE minerals from host rocks into the fluvial systems. This genesis and setting differentiate fluvial placer REE deposits from other mineral deposit types, emphasizing their dependency on surface and surficial geological processes."
8,8,Fluvial placer diamond,"Fluvial placer diamond deposits are also known as Alluvial diamond. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer diamond deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, kimberlite pipe.  Fluvial placer diamond deposits, also known as alluvial diamond deposits, are a distinctive subtype of placer deposits found predominantly in erosional environments. They are typically hosted in unconsolidated sediments, such as sand and gravel, and occasionally in conglomerate beds where paleoplacers might be preserved. The genesis of these deposits is closely associated with processes such as exhumation and erosion in areas with significant topographic relief, actively transporting diamonds from primary sources like kimberlite pipes or Archean greenstone belts. Found in passive streams or low-energy parts of drainage networks, these deposits can extend significant distances—up to 1,000 kilometers—from the parent kimberlite pipes. Fluvial placer diamonds are most commonly encountered with sediment from the Tertiary and Quaternary periods. The setting for these deposits is often within stable cratons, which provides a tectonic environment conducive to their preservation. The mineralogical composition is dominated by various diamond forms, including bort, carbonado, and ballas, differentiated by their polycrystalline nature and visual characteristics. A notable geochemical signature accompanies these deposits, marked by elements such as chromium, nickel, and niobium and heavy minerals typically indicative of underlying kimberlite, like pyrope garnet and magnesium-rich ilmenite. A unique structural feature includes the retention of sand grains in the crevices of diamonds, a vestige of their ancient sedimentary passage. The depositional controls focus on hydrodynamic concentration mechanisms, which favor the accumulation of heavier minerals like diamonds in low-velocity zones of fluvial systems. Compared to other mineral deposits, fluvial placer diamond deposits differentiate themselves through their distinctive occurrence in sedimentary environments and their capacity to reveal extensive geographical sediment transportation from a primary eruption site, demonstrated by notable examples in regions like Africa and Venezuela."
9,9,Fluvial placer gemstones,"Fluvial placer gemstones deposits are also known as Alluvial gemstones. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer gemstones deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, specific rock type. Fluvial placer gemstones type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39d. Fluvial placer gemstones type mineral deposits are also known as Diamond placer.  Fluvial placer gemstone deposits, such as diamond placers, form in erosional environments where water flow concentrates precious minerals in riverbeds, sand, or gravel from eroded upstream sources. Distinguished from igneous and hydrothermal deposits, these gemstones are transported and subsequently deposited by hydraulic action rather than directly precipitating in place. The host sediments for these alluvial deposits typically include sand, gravel, and clay, unlike the igneous and metamorphic rocks associated with corundum deposits. Key commodities extracted include diamonds and other gemstones, as opposed to corundum. Orebodies of fluvial placer deposits are characteristically elongated, following the current or historical pathways of rivers and streams within a drainage network system. These deposits, often found in alluvial plains and riverbeds influenced by topographic relief, usually exhibit lower grades than primary sources. However, the economic viability of these deposits comes from the relative ease of surface mining techniques. Their age of mineralization tends to align with late geological periods, including the Quaternary, marking a stark contrast with older primary hard rock deposits from the Proterozoic or Paleozoic eras. The process of ore concentration in fluvial placers is primarily physical, driven by mechanical erosion and transport, rather than chemical alterations typical of hydrothermal processes. Although tectonic settings are not the primary influence for formation, placers can be indirectly affected by tectonically driven uplift and erosion, leading to exposed sources ripe for erosion. Notably, fluvial placers stand out through the secondary nature of their mineral deposits, housed in softer sedimentary environments, and exploited more readily due to straightforward mechanical extraction methods compared to the more complex and challenging operations associated with primary mineral deposits."
10,10,Fluvial placer garnet,"Fluvial placer garnet deposits are also known as Alluvial garnet. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer garnet deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, specific rock type. Fluvial placer garnet type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39g. Fluvial placer garnet type mineral deposits are also known as Placer garnet.  Fluvial placer garnet deposits, also known as alluvial garnet deposits under the USGS deposit model number 39g, are characterized by the mechanical concentration of garnet grains in fluvial environments. These deposits typically develop in sedimentary settings where the surrounding metamorphic or igneous parent rocks, often rich in garnet, undergo erosion. The garnet, known for its durability, becomes concentrated in riverbeds, streambeds, and similar depositional environments, where water-driven processes lead to the sorting and stratification of sediments. Unlike primary hard rock sources, fluvial placer garnets are found as loose grains, often accumulated in lenses or beds, showing variable grades that reflect the local concentration of garnet-bearing sediments. The primary commodity extracted from these deposits is industrial garnet, utilized extensively for abrasive applications. The site’s physiography includes corridors of past or present water flow, such as rivers, streams, and deltas, highlighting the transport and depositional nature of these sediments. The mineralization process in fluvial hotspots is ongoing, without a specific geological age, as it is constantly influenced by current erosional and depositional activities. Alteration processes are generally minimal, focusing on mechanical weathering over chemical transformations. The main control factors for the location and quality of the deposits involve water flow dynamics, sedimentology, and the geomorphic evolution of drainage systems, which are influenced by topographical changes typically driven by tectonic uplift. These unique geological settings distinguish fluvial placer garnet deposits from other mineral deposit types, emphasizing the complex interaction of erosional processes, sediment transport, and natural sorting within dynamic fluvial environments. These geological features and processes collectively mark fluvial placer garnet deposits as distinct from magmatic or hydrothermal mineral deposits."
11,11,Heavy mineral sands,"Heavy mineral sands deposits are also known as Mineral sands. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Heavy mineral sands deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, delta, shoreline, barrier island, specific rock types. Heavy mineral sands type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39c. Heavy mineral sands type mineral deposits are also known as Shoreline placer Ti.  Heavy mineral sands deposits, also known as mineral sands or shoreline placer titanium (Ti) deposits, form through mechanical concentration in coastal environments, distinguished by their association with sedimentary processes rather than hydrothermal or magmatic activity typical of many other deposits. These deposits are composed primarily of ilmenite, rutile, and zircon, with economic by-products such as monazite, garnet, and sometimes gemstones. Found globally along wave-dominated shorelines and associated with present or paleo shorelines, they are notable for their detrital heavy minerals concentrated in thin, extensive layers along beaches, coastal dunes, and barrier islands. The typical host rocks are well-sorted, medium to coarse-grained sands, often exhibiting cross-stratification and containing lag gravels. Formation occurs mainly in passive continental margins and stable cratonic areas, where tectonic activity is minimal, favoring the long-term reworking by oceanic processes which winnow loose sediment and concentrate heavy minerals. These deposits are predominantly Cenozoic in age but range from Tertiary to Quaternary, depending on regional geology and climatic conditions. While grades can vary, ilmenite concentrations often fall within 1% to over 10%, leading to high tonnage despite low individual deposit grades. Heavy mineral sands stand out due to their unique genesis strictly linked to physical sedimentary processes and their position along coastlines, often leading to environmental constraints on mining due to proximity to water bodies and the need for extraction below the water table. These deposits are significant for producing titanium dioxide used in industries and zircon for ceramics, influencing global supply of versatile and essential mineral commodities distinct from other types like VMS or lode gold, which rely more on internal earth processes and hydrothermal systems."
12,12,Shoreline placer gold,"Shoreline placer gold deposits are also known as Beach placer gold. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Shoreline placer gold deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, delta, shoreline, barrier island, pre-existing mineralization.  Shoreline placer gold deposits, often referred to as beach placer gold, are characterized by their unique geologic features that distinguish them from other placer deposit types. These deposits consist primarily of unconsolidated sediments rich in heavy minerals such as gold, which are concentrated by the mechanical action of ocean waves and currents. The gold within these deposits originates from the erosion of bedrock sources, older placers, or mineralized zones, and it is transported to coastal regions by fluvial processes before being further concentrated by wave action. The primary commodity from these deposits is gold, which has historically yielded significant commercial value, exemplified by the substantial production in the Nome mining district, where shoreline placers have contributed millions of ounces. In terms of grade and tonnage, these deposits can vary greatly, but beach placers can be particularly rich due to the high-density sorting and concentration mechanisms of wave action. Shoreline placer deposits typically form in coastal environments with significant wave activity, developing as elongated, thin layers parallel to the shoreline within beach ridges or swash zones. They are of geologically recent age, commonly forming during the Quaternary period following glacial retreats. These deposits undergo minimal chemical alteration because their formation is dominantly driven by physical processes that sort and concentrate the heavy minerals along the coast. Ore control in these systems is heavily influenced by the geometry of the coastline, the intensity of wave energy, and the availability of sediment, with the richest areas often occurring at specific elevations tied to ancient wave action levels. Unlike many other deposit types, beach placers are not directly associated with tectonic activity; instead, their formation is primarily determined by erosional and depositional dynamics. This setting sets them apart from fluvial placer deposits that form in river channels or alluvial plains, emphasizing their unique dependence on coastal geomorphological processes for gold concentration."
13,13,Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands,"Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands deposits are also known as Lithified mineral sands; indurated mineral sands. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional.

Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39c. Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands type mineral deposits are also known as Shoreline placer Ti.  Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands deposits, or lithified mineral sands, are distinguished by their formation as sedimentary deposits that have undergone lithification over geologic time. These deposits are primarily found within sedimentary layers such as sandstones and conglomerates, which were originally unconsolidated sandy environments. Key ore types include ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite, valuable for titanium, zirconium, and rare earth element extractions. The commodities are typically lower grade compared to primary deposits due to dilution by non-ore materials but can exist in substantial tonnage. Formed in high-energy erosional settings like ancient shorelines, deltas, and barrier islands, these deposits often date back from the Precambrian to the Tertiary periods. Stratiform in nature, their orebodies conform to ancient depositional surfaces, reflecting their sedimentary origin. Alteration processes include secondary oxidation of iron-bearing minerals, while ore control is mediated by paleoenvironmental factors that concentrated minerals through processes of sorting facilitated by ancient beaches, river systems, and dunes. Structural characteristics include stratigraphic layering and preservation of paleo-relief, making them distinct from other mineral deposits formed in different geological settings. Tectonically, they are commonly associated with passive continental margins where minimal tectonic activity contrasts with more dynamic geological environments. Distinguishing paleoplacers is the sedimentary nature of their structures, their lithified state, and their erosional formation processes which depart from magmatic or hydrothermal origination methods of other deposits. Preservation of ancient topography further sets them apart from more recent, unconsolidated placer deposits."
14,14,Paleoplacer tin,"Paleoplacer tin deposits belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Paleoplacer tin deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, delta, shoreline, barrier island, specific rock types. Paleoplacer tin type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39e. Paleoplacer tin type mineral deposits are also known as Alluvial placer Sn.  Paleoplacer tin deposits, classified within the broader category of placer deposits, are geological formations distinguished by their historical accumulation of tin minerals within sedimentary environments. These deposits typically originate in erosional settings, where ancient topographic relief and well-developed drainage networks contributed to the weathering and transportation of tin-bearing minerals. The unique characteristics of paleoplacer tin deposits often include their occurrence within specific sedimentary rock types such as conglomerates and sandstones, which represent former high-energy environments like deltas, shorelines, and barrier islands. Unlike younger alluvial placers, paleoplacer deposits are often lithified or partially lithified, preserving a more complex geological history. The primary ore mineral is cassiterite (SnO₂), which is chemically stable and resistant to weathering, allowing it to concentrate over time. Grades and tonnage levels can vary significantly, influenced by the paleoenvironment's ability to concentrate cassiterite effectively over geological timescales. Mineralization typically dates back to the Precambrian or early Paleozoic eras, distinguishing these deposits by their ancient origins. They are often controlled by underlying structures such as paleo-valleys, faults, or unconformities that directed ancient sediment transport. Host rocks may undergo minimal alteration due to the physical concentration nature of these deposits, but secondary enrichment can occur in certain geochemical environments. Tectonically, paleoplacer tin formations are often associated with stable cratonic regions or passive margins, where long-term preservation of the deposit is facilitated by tectonic stability and slow rates of uplift and erosion. These distinguishing features set paleoplacer tin deposits apart from other tin deposit types like primary tin lode or greisen deposits, which typically form through hydrothermal processes and differ in both genesis and geological setting."
15,15,Paleoplacer gold ± uranium,"Paleoplacer gold ± uranium deposits are also known as Quartz pebble conglomerate Au-U. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional.

Paleoplacer gold ± uranium type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 29a. Paleoplacer gold ± uranium type mineral deposits are also known as Quartz pebble conglomerate Au-U (BC name is Paleoplacer U-Au-PGE-Sn-Ti.  Paleoplacer gold ± uranium deposits, also referred to as quartz-pebble-conglomerate Au-U, are geological formations primarily found in fluvial to littoral sedimentary environments featuring quartz-rich conglomerates and sandstones. These deposits are distinct due to their ancient age, mostly formed during the Archean to Paleoproterozoic eras, with significant examples like the Witwatersrand Basin in South Africa dating back to 2.97 to 2.71 billion years ago. The rock types involved include mature oligomictic pebble conglomerates that lack granite clasts, set within sequences of less mature sandstones. These deposits are composed of detrital pyrite, uraninite, and gold particles, with mineralization often occurring in fine, well-rounded grains. Physically, the deposits are suited to stable cratonic settings, often within epicontinental basins characterized by braided stream channels and alluvial fans on unconformity surfaces. The unique ability of these deposits to preserve detrital pyrite and uraninite, a result of low atmospheric oxygen levels during their formation, distinguishes them geochemically and mineralogically. The primary commodities extracted are gold and uranium, with significant byproducts including PGE, thorium, and occasionally diamonds, reflecting a diverse commodity structure. The deposits exhibit high tonnage levels, with Witwatersrand alone having produced around 40,000 tonnes of gold by 1987. The alteration processes are marked by diagenetic and metamorphic changes, such as pyrophyllite and chloritoid formations, while ore control is heavily influenced by ancient drainage patterns, topographic factors, and the presence of carbonaceous layers that reflect low-energy depositional environments. Structurally, these deposits are tabular and concordant with sedimentary layers, amplifying their distinction from other placers through their tectonic setting, age, and significant pyrite content without contemporary ferric oxide."
16,16,Bauxite,"Bauxite deposits are also known as Lateritic bauxite. They belong to the general deposit group of Laterite deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Bauxite deposits include: Stable area with low relief, tropical climate, Al-bearing rock types, unsaturated zone, water table. Bauxite type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 38b. Bauxite type mineral deposits are also known as Bauxite, laterite type.  Bauxite deposits, notably the lateritic type, are distinct in their geological features, arising from intense weathering in stable tropical environments. These deposits are commonly found overlying eroded and weathered formations, characterized by their association with pisolitic bauxite, high-silica bauxite, kaolinitic clay, and bauxitic clay. The orebodies often exhibit a layered structure, with a hard, pisolitic surface transitioning into softer, porous layers beneath, and are notable for their alumina (Al2O3) content, often ranging above 46.1%, marking their potential for substantial yields. These deposits typically develop on gentle slopes, forming blanket-like covers over previous land formations, indicating their physiographic preference for low-relief, stable regions. The mineralization process is intrinsically linked to lateritic weathering prevalent during tropical and subtropical ages, suggesting an evolving geological timeline. Structurally, bauxite deposits are controlled by stable, flat erosional surfaces, often resulting from post-Midway geological activities that provide an ideal setting for bauxite formation. Moreover, the presence of iron oxides and siderite signifies a critical alteration feature since high iron content can diminish alumina extraction efficiency. These deposits frequently exist within passive tectonic margins, encouraging the weathering stability necessary for bauxite genesis. A distinguishing feature of bauxite deposits is their resilience to physical erosion and the chemical weathering associated with tropical weathering profiles. Unlike other deposits, their formation over substrates like nepheline syenite contributes to the unique mineralogical challenges and processing difficulties due to higher iron concentrations. Collectively, these aspects outline the distinguishing and economically significant features of bauxite deposits, highlighting their dependency on specific climatic and geological conditions for formation."

Karst bauxite deposits, also known as carbonate bauxites or USGS deposit model number 38c, are a unique type of mineral deposit distinctly associated with karstified carbonate terrains. These deposits are predominantly found overlaying carbonate rock series such as limestone and dolostone, where extensive weathering processes occur. The primary commodity extracted from these deposits is aluminum, sourced from bauxite ore, which primarily comprises aluminum hydroxide minerals like gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspore. Karst bauxite deposits are typically located in stable terrains characterized by low topographic relief and a tropical or subtropical climate that facilitates intense supergene processes, such as leaching and weathering. The age of mineralization can vary considerably, with the majority of known deposits formed during the Cretaceous to Tertiary periods, taking advantage of climatic conditions conducive to bauxitization. Orebodies in karst bauxite deposits usually present as lenticular or irregular shapes, conforming to the topography of karst landscapes which include sinkholes and depressions created by the dissolution of carbonate rocks. These deposits are distinguished from other bauxite types by their formation in direct relation to carbonate bedrock rather than on silicate substrates, as seen in lateritic bauxites. The presence of terra rossa soils, which are often residual products of the dissolution of carbonate rocks, is a notable indicator of karst bauxite deposits. These deposits generally form in tectonically stable regions, as significant tectonic activity could disrupt the necessary weathering processes and drainage systems critical to their formation. The unique interplay of karst processes, climate, and geology distinguishes karst bauxite deposits from other forms of bauxite, offering valuable insights into historical geological and climatic conditions."
18,18,Laterite nickel,"Laterite nickel deposits are also known as Nickel-cobalt laterite: Lateritic nickel. They belong to the general deposit group of Laterite deposits.

Laterite nickel deposits, also known as nickel-cobalt laterites, form over ultramafic rocks such as serpentinized peridotite, dunite, and harzburgite, primarily in stable, low-relief tropical areas where intense weathering processes dominate. These supergene deposits feature a vertical zonation comprising an overburden, a ferruginous laterite or limonite zone enriched in iron oxide, and a saprolitic layer above the bedrock. The primary commodities are nickel, with grades typically around 1.3%, and cobalt, which averages 0.08%, alongside secondary elements like iron, magnesium, chromium, and traces of manganese, copper, and platinum group elements. Laterite nickel deposits vary significantly in size, from a few million to over 400 million tonnes. Within the geological timescale, mineralization ages span from the Mesozoic to present, witnessing substantial geological events like the Great Oxidation Event. Ore body shapes are diverse, ranging from plateau to linear forms, influenced by geomorphological and structural controls such as fractures and climatic conditions that dictate permeability and leaching efficiency. These deposits predominantly occur in cratonic tectonic settings and obducted ophiolite complexes often associated with fold belts and magmatic arcs. The process of lateritization under tropical climates not only distinguishes these deposits by enabling unique weathering profiles but also challenges their economic extraction. The metallurgical complexity necessitates advanced techniques like high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) and atmospheric leaching to process the heterogeneous mineralogy, contrasting with the simpler beneficiation strategies suitable for sulfide nickel deposits. The dependency on specific climatic and geological settings makes these deposits a significant yet complex component of the global nickel resource base, mostly concentrated in equatorial regions but extending beyond in specific geologic contexts."
19,19,Carbonatite laterite REE,"Carbonatite laterite REE deposits belong to the general deposit group of Laterite deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Carbonatite laterite REE deposits include: Stable area with low relief, tropical climate, carbonatites, unsaturated zone, water table. Carbonatite laterite REE type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 10. Carbonatite laterite REE type mineral deposits are also known as Carbonatite.  Carbonatite laterite REE (Rare Earth Element) deposits represent a distinctive variety of mineral deposits primarily associated with weathered carbonatite intrusions, characteristic of stable cratonic regions with tropical climates. These deposits form under supergene conditions, where prolonged chemical weathering occurs above carbonatite bodies, leading to the concentration of REEs within the laterite profile. The host rocks are predominantly composed of carbonatite, a rare igneous rock with high carbonate content, often accompanied by associated alkaline intrusions. The principal ore minerals include bastnäsite, monazite, and sometimes parisite, which are embedded in the lateritic profile enriched over geological timescales. In terms of commodity types, these deposits are highly sought after for their REE content, crucial for high-tech and green technologies. The grade and tonnage of carbonatite laterite REE deposits can be variable; however, they generally offer higher grades than many other REE deposit types due to the concentrated nature of the lateritic processes. Physiographically, these deposits typically occur in areas of low relief, promoting efficient drainage and leaching essential for lateritic development. The mineralization age can be varied, often reflecting the age of the parent carbonatite body. Orebody structures are generally not pronounced, as the mineralization appears as horizontal layers following the weathering profile's development. Alteration is dominated by intense leaching and secondary enrichment, facilitated by climate and hydrology. Ore control is primarily exerted by the thickness of the laterite profile and the development of iron-rich crusts which can trap REEs. These deposits are distinguished structurally by their association with stable, tectonically quiet settings, which allow for the long-term weathering necessary for laterite formation, setting them apart from other REE deposits that may be more directly related to magmatic processes or tectonic activity."
20,20,Laterite magnesite,"Laterite magnesite deposits belong to the general deposit group of Laterite deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene.

These deposits are primarily associated with the weathering of ultramafic and carbonate-rich rocks, particularly carbonatites, which contribute magnesium to the lateritic profile. The main commodity extracted is magnesite (MgCO₃), often occurring in association with iron oxides such as hematite and goethite due to the oxidizing conditions prevalent near the surface. Compared to other laterite deposits, magnesite laterites are distinguished by their high magnesium content and their development over ultramafic and carbonatite substrates. In terms of grade, magnesite concentration can vary, with high-grade deposits offering particularly pure magnesite for industrial uses like refractory material. The tonnage can vary significantly based on the thickness and lateral extent of the lateritic profile. Physiographically, these deposits are typically found on gentle slopes or flat terrains where the water table fluctuates above and below the magnesite-bearing horizon, which is crucial for the deposition and preservation of magnesite. The age of mineralization is generally Tertiary to recent, correlating with periods of intense tropical weathering. Ore bodies are usually extensive but relatively shallow, with magnesite often forming in the unsaturated zone above the water table. Alteration processes are dominated by leaching of silica and other mobile elements, leaving a residual concentration of magnesium and iron oxides. Ore control is closely linked to the lithology of the parent rock, climate, and the hydrological regime. These deposits commonly occur in tectonically stable areas where prolonged weathering can take place. Structures such as fractures can influence the movement of fluids and affect magnesite deposition, although they are generally less critical than in hypogene deposits.

21,21,Residual clay,"Residual clay deposits are also known as Secondary clay. They belong to the general deposit group of Clay deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Residual clay deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, Al-bearing rock types, water table.  Residual clay deposits, commonly referred to as Residual kaolin or Secondary clay, are distinguished by their formation through the persistent chemical weathering of aluminum-rich feldspathic rocks, such as granite, gneiss, and other related crystalline metamorphic and volcanic rocks like basalt and andesite. The resultant deposits are characterized by the predominance of kaolinite and halloysite minerals. These formations are typically irregular in shape, with physiographic features including residual boulders enveloped by progressively weathered rock layers, particularly in regions with less permeable parent rock. Economically, kaolin is the principal commodity extracted, with secondary products such as muscovite and sericite enhancing the deposit's value. The deposits are considered to have generally modest grade and tonnage, accounting for a minor share of global kaolin production. Mineralization predominantly occurred through katamorphic alteration processes during the Cretaceous (?) to Tertiary ages. Importantly, the formation of these mineral deposits is largely controlled by zones of groundwater movement within the host rocks, where meteoric waters, sometimes acidic, promote the alteration of feldspar to kaolinite or halloysite. Notably, these deposits might face competitive challenges in terms of economic feasibility due to the presence of other more economically robust kaolin deposit types. While the specific structural and tectonic settings of residual clay deposits are not explicitly defined, their genesis is inherently tied to supergene environmental conditions, reflecting broader geochemical weathering processes. Environmentally and economically, the processing of these deposits often necessitates beneficiation, particularly for halloysite, due to its elevated water content, and presents occupational health considerations, such as the risk of kaolinosis for workers exposed to clay dust."
22,22,"Underclay, overclay","Underclay, over-clay deposits are also known as Gob. They belong to the general deposit group of Clay deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene.

These deposits are distinct for their close association with Al-bearing and sometimes rare earth element (REE)-bearing shales, which may influence their mineralogical compositions. The rock types primarily associated with these deposits include kaolinite-rich clays, indicative of their formation in moist, weathered environments subjected to lateral and vertical percolation of groundwater, facilitating supergene processes. This environment supports the alteration of feldspar and mica through intense weathering, contributing to the compositional makeup suited for refractory applications, typified by high alumina content, a distinguishing commodity of fireclay. Geologically, underclay deposits often align with Carboniferous to Permian coal-bearing sequences, making their temporal occurrence significant in the stratigraphy of the regions in which they are found. In terms of ore control, factors such as topographic features influencing drainage patterns, climatic variability, and proximity to coal seams play major roles, with the latter significantly impacting the spatial distribution of these deposits. Physiographically, these deposits often occur in basins or depressions conducive to the accumulation of fine-grained sediments and accumulating organic matter required for coal formation. Structurally, these deposits are less influenced by tectonic stress compared to ore deposits that form in more active settings, yet they can exhibit bedding-plane controls that define their thickness and lateral continuity. Their low plasticity and refractory properties make them economically valuable, particularly in industrial applications like ceramics and the production of firebricks. Accordingly, understanding the interplay of geochemical, hydrological, and geological factors is crucial for distinguishing underclay and overclay deposits from other clay types, and underscores their special role in resource geology."

These deposits host REEs as ions or hydroxides adsorbed onto clay minerals, with primary hosts including minerals such as allanite, zircon, monazite, xenotime, and fluorocarbonates like bastnäsite and parisite. They are rich in both light and heavy REEs, with significant contributors being elements like lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, and yttrium. Typically found in thick weathered regolith profiles without significant erosion, these deposits exhibit REE concentrations ranging from 500 to over 3000 ppm. Originating from Neoproterozoic granites (age between 765 and 680 Ma) in the Southeastern United States, the REE distribution reflects progressive weathering, transitioning from igneous rock concentrations to fractionated concentrations in the regolith. Alteration processes such as hydrolysis of feldspars and biotite, along with weathering of minerals like allanite and apatite, are crucial for REE concentration. These deposits are controlled by chemical weathering, influenced by pH, solubility, and alteration products like clays. Structurally, they associate with lobate granite plutons, influenced by post-magmatic processes occurring in crustal extension tectonic settings, like the breakup of Rodinia. A distinguishing feature of ion adsorption REE deposits is the unique mineral patterns and tetrad behavior noted in highly fractionated granites, marked by pronounced hydrothermal alteration, differentiating them from other REE deposit types. They share geochemical and mineralogical similarities with ion adsorption deposits in South China, emphasizing processes like extensive weathering and specific source rock compositions, with exploration in areas like the Southeastern US potentially uncovering economically viable sources."
24,24,Supergene silver,"Supergene silver deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene silver deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting Ag-rich mineralization, water table.  Supergene silver deposits are distinctive geological formations resulting from the weathering processes that enhance the metal concentration in the near-surface environment, usually above preexisting Ag-rich mineralization. These deposits typically occur in arid to semi-arid climates where the unsaturated zone facilitates the oxidation of primary sulfides, leading to secondary enrichment. The host rock types generally include sedimentary, volcanic, or metamorphic rocks with preexisting silver sulfides or sulfosalts. The primary commodities extracted from these deposits are silver, although they may also contain secondary copper minerals. The ore is typically found in the form of native silver, chlorargyrite, or other oxidized silver minerals. Grades can vary significantly, but high-grade deposits with several hundred grams per tonne are most economically significant. Tonnage is typically moderate, and the mineralization can span a wide age range since it is primarily a secondary process occurring long after the initial deposition of primary ores. Orebodies are typically flat or gently dipping and are often found just below the weathered cap. Supergene processes involve significant alteration, including oxidation and leaching, which can lead to distinct zones of enrichment. Ore control is influenced by the presence of a fluctuating water table, where the percolating waters precipitate the metals as they descend. Structural elements, such as faults and fractures, play a critical role in pathways for mineralizing fluids. The tectonic setting is not strictly defined but relates more to the presence of existing mineralization and climatic conditions that favor supergene processes rather than specific orogenic events. What distinguishes Supergene silver deposits from other types is the secondary process of concentration of silver via weathering, enhancing the economic viability of ores that may not be rich enough in their primary form for traditional mining methods."
25,25,Supergene lead,"Supergene lead deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene.

The host rock types often include limestones, shales, and sandstones, which allow for the concentration of lead through leaching and precipitation mechanisms. The primary ore minerals include secondary lead oxides, carbonates, and sulfates, such as cerussite (PbCO3) and anglesite (PbSO4), resulting from chemical weathering of primary galena (PbS). Supergene processes enhance lead concentrations, typically at the expense of sulfide ore grades, enriching deposits to economically viable levels. These deposits are often shallow and elongate, aligned parallel to fault lines or stratigraphic layers that control fluid flow and ore deposition, providing a clear structural control. Physiographically, they can occur in upland regions or within basin margins where groundwater interactions are favorable. Tonnage and grade levels vary but are generally smaller and less concentrated than primary deposits; however, they are significant for their higher-grade averages facilitated by chemical reconcentration. Deposits can often be found in ancient terrains subjected to prolonged weathering epochs, aligning them more frequently with Mesozoic to Cenozoic tectonic settings where uplift and erosion expose Pb-mineralized bodies to surface conditions. These environments favor lead mobilization and precipitation, particularly in arid or semi-arid climates. Supergene processes transform the primary ores through oxidation, resulting in zones of secondary mineralization easily extractable due to the softer nature of the ore and host rock, distinguishing these deposits by their higher economic viability from a metal recovery perspective compared to their primary counterparts."

These deposits occur primarily in arid to semi-arid climates where pre-existing uranium-rich minerals undergo oxidation, mobilizing uranium into groundwater, which then reprecipitates upon encountering reducing conditions. The typical host rocks are sedimentary, especially sandstones, conglomerates, and calcretes, although weathered granites can also be involved. Ore types are dominated by minerals such as carnotite and tyuyamunite. These deposits often form in the vadose zone above the water table with grades frequently ranging from 0.05% to 0.4% U3O8, although higher concentrations can be locally significant. The tonnages can vary widely but are generally smaller than primary uranium deposits. Physiographically, these deposits are often located in flat-lying terrains or gently undulating landscapes conducive to broad, slow-moving groundwater flow. The age of mineralization can be quite young, ranging from Miocene to Pleistocene, reflecting ongoing geochemical processes. Supergene mineralogical alteration is characterized by the oxidation of primary uranium minerals and the dissolution-precipitation cycling. Ore control is strongly governed by the availability of reducing agents such as organic matter or ferrous iron, which facilitate the precipitation of uranium. Structures like fractures, faults, and porous sedimentary layers enhance groundwater movement and uranium transport. Tectonic settings are less crucial compared to hydrological conditions; however, stable cratonic environments or foreland basins with suitable hydrology are common. What differentiates supergene uranium deposits from other types is their reliance on surface and near-surface geochemical processes for uranium concentration, leading to relatively high-grade ores localized by specific geochemical traps rather than large-scale crustal processes."

These deposits are formed in the regolith, a layer of loose, heterogeneous material covering solid rock, and exhibit distinctive features such as residual or alluvial concentrations of gold. The presence of a variable climate is crucial, often where seasonal changes promote oxidative weathering that leads to the mobilization and concentration of gold. Unlike other gold deposit types, supergene gold is found primarily within oxidized rock types and regolith, often presenting as nuggets or fine particles. They are typically low-tonnage but can display high-grade concentrations, as the supergene processes concentrate gold by removal of gangue materials and enriching the residual deposit. The physiographic settings are usually stable, flat-lying terrains with a clear distinction between the oxidized and unoxidized zones. Mineralization ages vary, as supergene processes can remobilize gold from older primary deposits. Supergene alterations include oxidation, especially the dissolution and re-precipitation of gold, often accompanied by iron oxides and hydroxides. Ore controls are primarily climatic and hydrological, as these factors influence weathering and gold mobilization. Structurally, supergene gold is typically associated with stable cratonic regions where tectonic activity exposes underlying primary deposits to surface processes without causing significant deformation. This tectonic inactivity distinguishes supergene deposits from those in more dynamic environments where tectonic forces play a larger role in ore formation. Overall, supergene gold deposits are unique for their secondary enrichment processes, with climatic conditions and regolith development playing a critical role in their formation and preservation, setting them apart from primary or hypogene gold deposits."

Supergene copper deposits are characterized by their formation within the weathering zone of pre-existing sulfide deposits, typically in arid to semi-arid climates with distinct wet and dry seasons that promote oxidation processes. These deposits frequently overlay older hypogene porphyry copper deposits. The defining feature of supergene copper deposits is their secondary enrichment process, where primary sulfide minerals like chalcopyrite are oxidized to form secondary minerals such as malachite, azurite, chrysocolla, and native copper. These enrichments occur near the water table level where oxygen-rich meteoric water infiltrates, leading to the leaching of copper from upper sulfide zones and re-precipitation below, often forming enriched blankets of economically viable copper concentrations. Host rocks are generally composed of porphyritic granodiorites or other intrusive igneous rocks, with secondary deposits often occurring in sedimentary layers. Typically, these deposits yield copper with high grades due to secondary enrichment, with grades ranging from 0.2% to more than 5% copper, and can vary significantly in tonnage from tens of thousands to several billion metric tonnes. The orebody often exhibits tabular and irregular shapes, controlled by the original ore distribution and the permeability of host rocks. Structurally, supergene copper deposits may be influenced by faults and fractures that facilitate fluid movement but are generally not dominated by tectonic activities. The mineralization age varies, but the supergene process operates over a geologically short period, coinciding with current climatic conditions. Noteworthy alteration includes oxidation and the formation of secondary carbonates and oxides. In summary, supergene copper deposits distinguish themselves by their unique genesis involving surface weathering processes, leading to the enrichment of copper near the surface, contrasting sharply with the deeper, primary magmatic processes of hypogene deposits."

Sandstone uranium type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 30c. Sandstone uranium type mineral deposits are also known as Sandstone U.  Sandstone uranium deposits, commonly referred to as roll-front deposits, are significant sources of uranium and are typically found within sedimentary basins where permeable, coarse-grained clastic rocks such as sandstones and conglomerates exist. These formations are interbedded with finer-grained, impermeable layers like shales which facilitate groundwater movement, creating a suitable redox boundary necessary for uranium precipitation. The primary ore mineral is uraninite, alongside secondary minerals like coffinite and carnotite, with associated commodities sometimes including vanadium and selenium. These deposits generally exhibit a lens-shaped or crescent-like morphology, forming extensive, arcuate, roll-front patterns along the redox front, where oxidizing groundwater containing dissolved uranium encounters reducing conditions, often influenced by organic material or sulfur compounds. The deposits are typically of Cenozoic and Mesozoic age, though the precise age can vary depending on the specific basin. Average grades for these deposits are generally low, often ranging from 0.05% to 0.2% U3O8, but they can achieve considerable cumulative tonnages. Physically, these deposits often present in flat-lying, permeable rock layers within larger, gently dipping stratigraphic sequences, with geomorphological settings including areas such as fluvial or deltaic channels, marginal marine environments, and alluvial plains. Alteration processes primarily involve the oxidation of the host rock, with hematization observable due to the presence of iron oxides from the leaching action. Key ore controls include the redox interface, lithological variations, and structural features like faults and fractures that facilitate fluid movement. Tectonically, these deposits are typically located in stable cratonic regions or foreland basins, distinguished by their unique formation processes driven by the infiltration of uranium-rich groundwater, setting them apart from magmatic or metamorphically associated uranium deposits."
36,36,Carbonate uranium,"Carbonate uranium deposits belong to the general deposit group of Uranium deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Carbonate uranium deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, aquifers, preexisting volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks, redox interface.  Carbonate uranium deposits are a distinctive type of uranium mineralization characterized by their formation through the infiltration of oxidized surface or meteoric waters that percolate through carbonate-rich sedimentary sequences. These deposits typically occur in regions with preexisting volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks, which provide an essential source of uranium. The presence of a redox interface is crucial as it promotes the precipitation of uranium minerals when oxidizing fluids encounter reducing conditions within aquifers, often hosted within limestones, dolostones, or carbonate-cemented sandstones. This mineralization process results in the deposition of uraninite (UO2) and coffinite (U(SiO4)1-x(OH)4x), among other secondary uranium minerals like carnotite (K2(UO2)2(VO4)2·3H2O). The deposits typically reside within shallow, near-surface environments, sometimes associated with basin margins or paleochannels, and exhibit a range of grades and tonnages, often moderate in size compared to larger unconformity-related deposits. Alteration halos can include the oxidation of host rocks and the development of clay minerals such as kaolinite and illite. Structurally, carbonate uranium deposits often align along fault zones or fracture networks, which facilitate fluid movement and uranium deposition. Tectonically, they are typically found in stable, intracratonic basins or at the margins of tectonic provinces where porous carbonate rocks are available. The age of mineralization can vary but is often linked to geological periods where conditions were favorable for the extensive weathering required for surface infiltration, commonly ranging from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic eras. Distinct from other uranium deposit types like unconformity-related or sandstone-hosted, carbonate uranium deposits are distinguished by their carbonate-rich hosts, infiltration genesis, specific mineral associations, and the critical role of surface-derived oxidizing conditions in their formation."
37,37,Coal/peat/bog uranium,"Coal/peat/bog uranium deposits belong to the general deposit group of Uranium deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Coal/peat/bog uranium deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, aquifers, preexisting volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks, redox interface.  Coal/peat/bog uranium deposits are a unique category of uranium deposits characterized by their formation in environments rich in organic material, such as peat bogs, coal seams, or lignite beds. These deposits typically form through the infiltration of surface water carrying uranium into a reducing environment provided by the organic content, often at a redox interface where oxidized uranium becomes reduced and precipitates. The host rocks are usually sedimentary, incorporating preexisting volcanic ash layers that contribute to the uranium concentration. The ore type primarily consists of uraniferous organic material, and the uranium can be associated with minerals such as uraninite or complex organic-bound uranium compounds. Grade and tonnage can vary significantly, but these deposits are typically of moderate grade compared to high-grade deposits like those found in Canadian Athabasca Basin. The physiography of coal/peat/bog uranium deposits often involves flat-lying sedimentary basins or ancient lake beds. They are typically younger in terms of geological age, often forming in Cenozoic or Quaternary periods. The orebody generally lacks sharp boundaries and is diffusely distributed throughout the host organic material. Alteration processes involve the transformation of organic material, which can affect the mobility of uranium. Tectonic settings are generally stable continental interiors where sedimentary depositional environments predominate. What distinguishes these deposits from other uranium types is their dependence on organic-rich lithologies and the role of biochemical processes in localizing and concentrating uranium. Ore control is heavily influenced by the presence and preservation of peat and coal beds, with uranium occurring along redox fronts governed by water table fluctuations and biochemical interactions. These settings make coal/peat/bog uranium deposits distinct from hard rock uranium deposits in igneous or metamorphic terranes, as they are closely related to surficial depositional and diagenetic processes."
38,38,Calcrete uranium,"Calcrete uranium deposits are also known as Surficial uranium, evaporite uranium. They belong to the general deposit group of Uranium deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Calcrete uranium deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, aquifers, preexisting volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks, lacustrine evaporite.  Calcrete uranium deposits, also identified as surficial or evaporite uranium deposits, are distinct in their formation within semi-arid to arid environments where the evaporation of water from calcrete (calcium carbonate) rich environments plays a crucial role. The primary host rock for these deposits is calcrete, though they also form in settings featuring volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks and evaporites, particularly in shallow basins or depressions with alkaline, uranium-rich groundwater. Unlike deeper, more structurally complex uranium deposit types, calcrete uranium deposits occur near the surface and are sediment-hosted, often characterized by broad, thin, horizontal ore bodies. The principal ore mineral is carnotite, a hydrated potassium uranium vanadate, and the deposits are formed through the precipitation of uranium as surface water percolates and evaporates, concentrating uranium in calcrete horizons. This mineralizing process results in relatively low-grade material compared to other types like unconformity-related or roll-front uranium deposits, but they can possess significant tonnage. Calcrete uranium deposits typically form during geologically recent periods and are common in places with tectonically stable settings such as Australia and Namibia. Structurally, these deposits are controlled by factors like sedimentary basin development and aquifer flow pathways, with the uranium precipitating in areas where groundwater loses CO2 and pH changes occur. Distinguishing features include their association with regions of alkaline groundwater, evaporative climatic conditions, and lack of significant associated tectonic deformation. The simplicity of their geology and above-ground mining potential makes them economically attractive, particularly in regions where typical high-grade deposits are absent."
39,39,Nodular magnesite,"Nodular magnesite deposits are also known as Cryptocrystalline magnesite. They belong to the general deposit group of Magnesite deposits.

Genetically related features of typical Nodular magnesite deposits include: Infiltration of CO2-bearing surface water into fractured ultramafic rocks.  Nodular magnesite deposits, also referred to as cryptocrystalline magnesite, present distinct geological features that differentiate them from other mineral deposit types. These deposits predominantly form within serpentinized ultramafic rocks, such as dunite and peridotite, sometimes accompanied by pyroxenite, pillow basalt, and sheeted dikes. The primary component of these deposits is magnesite, occasionally found with talc by-products. Characterized by a relatively small size, nodular magnesite deposits typically manifest as lenticular masses, veins, and stockworks, with vein dimensions ranging from a few feet to hundreds of feet in length and a few inches to tens of feet in width. They are generally associated with ophiolite complexes and accreted terranes, highlighting a tectonic setting conducive to their formation. The deposits are formed through the infiltration of CO2-bearing surface waters into fractured ultramafic host rocks, resulting in carbonatization, a dominant alteration process. The host rocks’ fracture systems, faults, and shear zones frequently control ore localization. Age-wise, mineralization spans from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic era. Unique to these deposits is their cryptocrystalline texture, occasionally fibrous or granular, which allows for relatively easier beneficiation due to lower iron and boron content. Nodular magnesite’s resilience to weathering often leads to topographic highs, distinguishable by its rusty brown color due to weathering processes. Such nodular deposits are more resilient than dolomite, posing potential health and environmental concerns due to the presence of tremolite-actinolite gangue minerals. Extraction often requires underground mining due to the irregular and narrow shape of the deposits, and magnesite from these formations can be processed more energy-efficiently than brine-sourced magnesia."

Genetically related features of typical Marine evaporite gypsum deposits include: Silled marine basin, arid climate, pinnacle reefs, evaporites, sabkha dolomites. Marine evaporite gypsum type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 35ae. Marine evaporite gypsum type mineral deposits are also known as Bedded gypsum: marine evaporite gypsum.  Marine evaporite gypsum deposits, a subset of evaporite deposits, are predominantly composed of gypsum, with no accompanying by-products. These deposits are primarily situated in subsiding marginal marine basins near continental margins, where periodic seawater influx and evaporation occur, leading to the precipitation of calcium sulfate. The characteristic host rocks include dolomite, with associated rocks often comprising anhydrite, limestone, and halite. These deposits span a wide age range from the Late Proterozoic to the Miocene, with the Paleozoic and Mesozoic being the most common periods of formation. Ore mineralogy is dominated by gypsum, frequently interlaminated with trace calcite or dolomite, while the gangue minerals also include calcite and dolomite. Gypsum forms through the hydration of anhydrite, with quality reliant on hydration extent, influenced by groundwater that may alter deposit structure through changes in porosity or dissolution. The structural setting is defined by basins with moderate subsidence, and ore control is governed by brines within these evaporative environments reaching sufficient salinity. Bedded gypsum deposits can range from 10 to 50 meters in thickness and cover extensive areas. Weathering can dissolve gypsum deposits unless located in arid climates, while metamorphism can generate skarn minerals. Mining typically employs strip mining or underground methods for deeper occurrences, with economic viability impacted by the gypsum's purity and transportation costs due to minimal beneficiation requirements. Explorers use basin-edge sediment indicators and high-sulfate brines to identify potential deposits, and geophysical surveys may highlight gypsum's water content through a high neutron log response. This combination of geological, structural, and economic characteristics differentiates marine evaporite gypsum deposits from other mineral deposit types."

Marine evaporite salt deposits are significant geological features characterized by their origin in marine basins with rapid subsidence and high saline inflows necessary for sodium chloride precipitation. These deposits primarily yield halite, with anhydrite serving as a major host rock alongside lesser amounts of limestone and dolomite. Notably, the Silurian Salina Formation, Permian Hutchinson salt, Mississippian Charles Formation, and Permian Zechstein evaporites are prominent examples. Spanning an age range from the Late Proterozoic to Miocene, such deposits form in marginal marine basins, often near continental margins where seawater inflow is prevalent. Typically, these deposits are found in basins that experienced extensive subsidence, leading to the development of thick, extensive layers of bedded salt—ranging from 10 to 100 meters in thickness and covering vast areas. The halite is frequently interlayered with anhydrite, reflecting the high salinity conditions necessary for salt deposition. Marine evaporite salt deposits are distinct as they typically lack by-products, focusing solely on sodium chloride, utilized in chemical industries and for snow and ice control. Exploration relies on identifying high-salinity brines, with bromine content in these salts ranging from 60 to 200 ppm providing a distinct geochemical signature. Structural settings and ore control are influenced by the basin’s brines and inflows, with marine evaporite environments requiring more stringent purity levels due to economic factors like transportation costs. Environmental conditions, such as arid climates, preserve surface salt deposits, whereas regional metamorphism can obliterate these deposits, altering surrounding rocks through processes like albitization. The economic viability of these deposits hinges on their purity and proximity to infrastructure, emphasizing the delicate balance needed between mining operations and logistical costs."

They are characterized by their stratigraphic sequences of evaporite minerals like halite (rock salt) and sylvite, which may form in extensive, horizontally-layered bedded formations. These deposits often arise in arid climates where restricted marine conditions facilitate the concentration and precipitation of potassium salts as water bodies evaporate. Their genesis is commonly linked with tectonically stable settings that allow for the development of geographically extensive evaporite basins. Pinnacle reefs, sabkha dolomites, and other carbonate formations often coexist with these deposits, providing unique structural and textural features that aid in the trapping and localization of potash minerals. The age of Marine evaporite potash deposits can vary widely, frequently appearing in sedimentary basins from the Permian to the Quaternary periods. Ore control is largely dictated by the original basin morphology and subsequent geological modifications, with faulting or folding playing vital roles in redistributing potash-rich layers. These deposits are distinct from other mineral deposit types due to their specific environmental requirements for formation, which include prolonged evaporation phases and a highly saline environment. Distinguishing features may also include their substantial thickness and lateral continuity, often resulting in large tonnage and high-grade potash resources, making them a target for mining operations. The association of potash with other evaporites such as gypsum and anhydrite adds a complex suite of minerals that must be managed in mining and processing. Collectively, these features position Marine evaporite potash deposits as an essential component of the global potash supply chain, crucial for agricultural fertilizers."

The primary ore minerals are trona (Na\(_2\)CO\(_3\)·NaHCO\(_3\)·2H\(_2\)O) and nahcolite (NaHCO\(_3\)), with additional minerals such as dawsonite, shortite, and halite, underlining the deposit's complexity. The commodity of major economic interest is soda ash, derived from sodium carbonate. Mineralization predominantly dates to the Middle Eocene, roughly 46-50 million years ago, positioning these deposits as key paleoenvironmental archives. Structurally, they are noteworthy for their genesis in asymmetric sedimentary-structural basins influenced by Laramide tectonics, with high-angle faults contributing to the conditions favorable for formation. The depositional environment experienced significant volcanic influence and is marked by an absence of sulfate minerals, resulting from comprehensive bacterial sulfate reduction, thus distinguishing these deposits from other sodium carbonate-sulfate-chloride formations. This unique geochemical signature is accompanied by ore control factors like early diagenetic processes in a high ion concentration environment conducive to sodium carbonate precipitation. The trona and nahcolite mineralization typically manifests in thick, stratified beds, while mineral alterations, such as dissolution from groundwater, highlight dynamic post-depositional processes. These deposits, particularly in locations like Wyoming and Colorado, represent one of the world's most substantial sodium carbonate sources, underlined by the vast trona beds of the Wilkins Peak Member and the pivotal role these deposits play in global soda ash supply."

The host rocks are usually paleoproterozoic to mesoproterozoic oxygen-poor sandstones overlying metamorphosed granitoid and gneissic basement rocks, which often contain graphite. The ores are rich in uranium oxides, predominantly uraninite and pitchblende, with associated commodities like nickel, cobalt, and lead in some cases. The mineralization often occurs close to the unconformity at depths typically less than a kilometer, leading to high-grade deposits with grades often exceeding 2% U3O8, which distinguishes them from other uranium deposit types. Tonnage can be significant, ranging from several thousand to over a hundred thousand tonnes of uranium. These deposits are geologically young, often forming around 1.7-1.5 billion years ago, and are characterized by intense alteration halos. Alteration involves clay minerals such as illite and chlorite, along with hematite, indicative of an oxidized, acidic to neutral fluid environment. Structural controls are crucial, with mineralization often localized along fault zones that acted as conduits for mineralizing fluids, typically basin-derived brines. Tectonically, these deposits form in stable cratonic regions that experienced extensional tectonics, facilitating basin development and fluid flow. The presence of redox interfaces with reducing basement rocks, enhanced by structural conduits and hydrothermal fluids, distinguishes unconformity-related uranium deposits from other types, offering both economic and exploration significance due to their high grade and potential large size."

While Grades can vary, these deposits often exhibit high concentrations of light REEs, such as lanthanum and cerium, and may also contain significant levels of yttrium and heavy REEs, favorable for economic extraction. The physiographical attributes typically relate to high-relief terrains, often involving significant erosion that exposes the deposit at or near the surface. In terms of age, Breccia pipe REE deposits can span a range of geological periods, although they are often associated with relatively young tectonic-magmatic events in geological terms. Orebodies typically present as irregular, vertically extensive pipes or columns due to highly localized brecciation and fluid activity, with prevalent hydrothermal alteration zones manifesting as silicification and potassic alteration. The structural control is predominantly related to the emplacement along pre-existing fault lines or fracture zones which focus fluid flow. Breccia pipes contrast with other REE deposits by their unique association with magmatic processes and structurally-controlled brecciation, setting them apart from sedimentary or purely magmatic REE deposit types."
134,134,Carlin-type gold,"Carlin-type gold deposits are also known as Sediment-hosted disseminated gold, sediment-hosted micron gold. They belong to the general deposit group of Carlin-type deposits. The deposit environment is typically Magmatic hydrothermal. Genetically related features of typical Carlin-type gold deposits include: Slab rollback, arc migration, magmatic volatiles, extensional faults, reduced slope facies, meteoric water, CO2, H2S and hydrolytic metasomatism, jasperoids.  Carlin-type gold deposits are a distinguished class of gold deposits primarily recognized in Nevada, USA, though similar conditions and deposits exist globally. These deposits are primarily hosted in silty carbonate rocks, such as silty limestones and dolomites, often associated with siliciclastic sequences. The gold occurs in a disseminated, or ""invisible,"" form, incorporated into the lattice of arsenian pyrite or marcasite rather than in visible gold veins. These deposits primarily yield gold but also feature arsenic as a significant trace element. Carlin-type deposits are characterized by moderate grades ranging from 1 to 5 grams per tonne, yet can feature large tonnage, often in the hundreds of millions of tonnes. Geologically, they are found in extensional tectonic settings featuring horst and graben structures with low relief to moderate mountainous physiography. Mineralization typically dates from the late Eocene to early Miocene, about 40 to 25 million years ago, particularly in the western United States. The orebodies manifest in tabular forms paralleling bedding planes, often located along fault zones or lithological contacts. Comprehensive alteration is notable, with processes such as decarbonatization, silicification (notably forming jasperoids), argillization, and sulfidation. Structural controls, such as fault systems, are integral to ore deposition, with extensional faults and tectonic activities like slab rollback and arc migration influencing formation. Uniquely, Carlin-type deposits lack extensive quartz veining, a common feature in other gold deposit types, and necessitate specific geochemical states with reduced sulfur and arsenic, contributing to their distinctiveness in the broader spectrum of sediment-hosted mineralization."

Gold, the primary metal of interest, frequently associates with native bismuth and is found both in oxidized and sulfide forms. Notably, the oxide zones often display higher gold grades compared to their sulfide counterparts, as evidenced by deposits like those in the Peel Zone, which show significant supergene oxidation processes. The mineralizing event is mid-Cretaceous, driven by hydrothermal systems believed to be related to deep-seated intrusive stocks. Tectonically, these deposits align with mid-Cretaceous doming and uplift events that facilitated the emplacement of ore minerals through structural conduits like the Junction and Peel Faults. Structural preparation in these settings involves fault-controlled pathways that localize mineralization, with laminated and brecciated textures fortifying these pathways. Intense oxidation and remobilization of gold uniquely characterize these deposits, with oxidation processes often leading to enhanced gold enrichment near mantos' hanging walls. Physiographically, these deposits are often situated on anticline flanks where steep dipping increases structural permeability. This interplay of intricate geological, structural, and chemical processes underscores the uniqueness of Replacement gold-silver deposits, setting them apart by the interaction of hydrothermal activity, oxidation, and tectonic factors facilitating significant and localized metal enrichment."

Chromite, the primary commodity, typically occurs in these deposits with grades ranging from 20% to 60% Cr₂O₃, and the potential for platinum-group elements presence. Notably, these deposits are characterized by podiform orebodies, such as lens-shaped, rod-like, or irregular masses embedded in serpentinized host rocks. The grade and size vary significantly, with deposit sizes ranging from a few thousand to several million tonnes, with particular examples like the Coto orebody in the Philippines containing 13 million tonnes. The age of mineralization ranges largely from the Archean to the Mesozoic, with most significant deposits being younger. The physical manifestation includes nodular textures resulting from high degrees of deformation within high-strain tectonic environments, such as suprasubduction zones or mid-ocean ridges. Tectonically, these deposits align with obducted oceanic or back-arc crusts, representing mantle tectonite or cumulate sequences. They are typically altered by serpentinization, with associated minerals like talc and chlorite. Structurally, they are controlled by geophysical anomalies and crust-mantle transitions. These features distinctly differentiate Ophiolite chromium deposits from stratiform chromite deposits, which occur in stable continental settings and exhibit larger, more regular geological formations. The complex, irregular nature and challenging geological setting make exploration for podiform chromites intricate, yet they remain integral to the metallurgical sector for chromium sourcing."
183,183,Ophiolite nickel-copper-PGE,"Ophiolite nickel-copper-PGE deposits are also known as Picrite-tholeiite Ni-Cu-PGE. They belong to the general deposit group of Ophiolite deposits. The deposit environment is typically Magmatic. Genetically related features of typical Ophiolite nickel-copper-PGE deposits include: Obducted oceanic or back arc crus..  Ophiolite nickel-copper-platinum group element (PGE) deposits are distinctive magmatic deposits associated with obducted fragments of oceanic or back-arc crust, known as ophiolites. These deposits form through the magmatic differentiation of ultramafic and mafic rocks, primarily picrites and tholeiitic basalts, which are characteristic of ophiolite complexes. The main commodities extracted from these deposits include nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and PGEs, namely palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), and rhodium (Rh). The ores are typically sulfide-rich, comprising minerals such as pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite, which are precipitated from magmas enriched in sulfur. Ophiolite Ni-Cu-PGE deposits are unique due to their geological setting within obducted oceanic lithosphere, distinguishing them from deposits in continental rift or cratonic environments. These mineralized bodies are often found along tectonic plate boundaries and are associated with extensive faulting and thrusting during subduction and obduction processes. The age of mineralization typically corresponds to the timing of ophiolite emplacement, which can range from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic era. Ore bodies in these deposits are variable in size and shape, often occurring as lenses or disseminated sulfides within large ultramafic host rock units. Alteration zones can include serpentinization of olivine-rich rocks and later silicification or carbonatization. The structural control is often dictated by lithological contrasts and pre-existing tectonic features. Grades and tonnage of these deposits can be diverse, with some deposits displaying high PGE concentrations, making them economically significant. The tectonic setting of ophiolite deposits—specifically their formation in mid-ocean ridge and supra-subduction zone environments—and their subsequent obduction onto continental margins, are key factors that delineate Ophiolite Ni-Cu-PGE deposits from other magmatic orogenic systems."
184,184,Arc U-M intrusion titanium-vanadium,"Arc U-M intrusion titanium-vanadium deposits are also known as Alaskan-type, uralian-type. They belong to the general deposit group of Ultramafic and (or) mafic intrusion deposits. The deposit environment is typically Magmatic. Genetically related features of typical Arc U-M intrusion titanium-vanadium deposits include: Convergent margin, ultramafic-mafic magmatic center.  Arc U-M intrusion titanium-vanadium (Alaskan-type, Uralian-type) mineral deposits are primarily characterized by their association with ultramafic to mafic rock types such as dunite, wehrlite, harzburgite, and various forms of gabbro. These deposits commonly occur in unstable tectonic settings associated with convergent margins and ultramafic-mafic magmatic centers, typically emplaced at shallow crustal levels intruding granodiorite, island arc, or ophiolite terranes. The age of mineralization spans from the Precambrian to the late Mesozoic, with significant occurrences during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Key mineral assemblages in these deposits include chromite, Pt-Fe alloys, Ti-V magnetite, alongside other minerals such as pentlandite and chalcopyrite. Textures such as cumulus and poikilitic, along with structures like layered formations and mush flow textures, are notable features. Although these deposits exhibit minimal alteration, post-mineralization serpentinization is possible. Ore control is closely tied to specific rock types, facilitating magmatic differentiation processes, while mechanical weathering may lead to the formation of placer deposits. These geological characteristics—along with a distinctive geochemical signature including Cr, PGE, Ti, V, Cu, and Ni—differentiate Arc U-M intrusion titanium-vanadium deposits from other mineral deposit types. They are particularly noted for their unique mineral associations, such as magnetite segregations enriched in Ti and V, and the occurrence of PGE placer deposits. Such deposits are typically found in regions like the Klamath Mountains, where they exhibit low chromium and nickel content compared to other global counterparts, providing a unique fingerprint for these geological formations."
185,185,Arc U-M intrusion nickel-copper-PGE,"Arc U-M intru-sion nickel-copper-PGE deposits are also known as Alaskan-type, uralian-type, picrite-tholeiite Ni-Cu-PGE. They belong to the general deposit group of Ultramafic and (or) mafic intrusion deposits. The deposit environment is typically Magmatic. Genetically related features of typical Arc U-M intru-sion nickel-copper-PGE deposits include: Convergent margin, ultramafic-mafic magmatic center. Arc U-M intrusion nickel-copper-PGE type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 9. Arc U-M intrusion nickel-copper-PGE type mineral deposits are also known as Alaskan Cr-Pt (PGE).  Arc U-M intrusion nickel-copper-PGE (Platinum Group Elements) type mineral deposits, also known as Alaskan-type intrusions, are characterized by their occurrence in layered ultramafic and mafic rock compositions, typically forming in unstable tectonic environments such as convergent margins. Key rock types associated with these deposits include dunite, wehrlite, harzburgite, various pyroxenites, gabbros, and norite, often exhibiting cumulus, poikilitic, and mush flow textures. The age of these deposits ranges from Precambrian to Late Mesozoic, with a prevalence in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. These deposits intrude granodiorite, island arc, or ophiolite terranes, suggesting shallow emplacement levels. In terms of mineralogy, the ores comprise two main assemblages: one dominated by chromite and Pt-Fe alloys forming clots in dunite and harzburgite, and another by Ti-V magnetite layers within wehrlite and pyroxenite. Notably, these deposits feature limited pre- or syn-mineralization alteration, predominantly displaying post-mineralization serpentinization. Ore controls are primarily linked to magmatic processes specific to the rock types, and the deposits exhibit unique weathering processes such as mechanical weathering that leads to placer deposits and chemical weathering forming laterites. Geochemically, these deposits are marked by elements like Cr, various PGEs (Pt, Pd, Rh, Os, Ir), Ti, V, Cu, Ni, S, and As, with some assemblages having low Cr and Ni concentrations. The zoning pattern of ultramafic to felsic rocks and the concentric zoning of chromite and Ti-V magnetite differentiate these deposits from other types. Classic examples of Arc U-M intrusion deposits include those found in the Urals, Duke Island, Guseva-Gora, and Tin Cup Peak, highlighting their distinct geological identity."
186,186,Anorthosite massif titanium,"Anorthosite mas-sif titanium deposits are also known as Anorthosite pluton. They belong to the general deposit group of Anorthosite massif deposits. The deposit environment is typically Magmatic. Genetically related features of typical Anorthosite mas-sif titanium deposits include: Convergent margin, late extension, intermediate plutonic center. Anorthosite massif titanium type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 7b. Anorthosite massif titanium type mineral deposits are also known as Anorthosite Ti.  Anorthosite massif titanium deposits are significant for being predominantly associated with large anorthosite complexes, consisting chiefly of plagioclase feldspar with varying anorthite content. They are genetically related to magmatic environments, particularly within Proterozoic massifs, typically located at convergent margins during late extension phases. These deposits commonly involve mafic to ultramafic lithologies including gabbro, troctolite, and ferrogabbro, where titaniferous ilmenite and magnetite serve as primary ore types, sometimes accompanied by accessory minerals like garnet or spinel. The geological setting of these deposits is characterized by large, dome-shaped intrusions with stratigraphic control critical to ore concentration, often reflecting magmatic layering and cumulate textures that signify primary crystallization processes. The physiographic regions housing these deposits often assume regional dome shapes due to the buoyancy of the anorthosite bodies. Structure-wise, they are formed in late-stage fractures and replacement zones, facilitated by extensional tectonics which aid in their emplacement. A hallmark of their ore body is the minimal alteration, attributed to the initial stability of the primary minerals, although local metamorphic effects might occur due to nearby geological processes. Economic potential is bolstered by high tonnage and variable titanium grades, though specific grades and tonnage figures tend to be site-dependent. These deposits are distinguished from other magmatic mineral deposits by their unique formation within orogenic belts' intermediate plutonic centers, under specific tectonic conditions combining convergent margin settings with extension, contrasting with magmatic systems forming under solely extensional or compressional regimes and lacking such distinct association with plagioclase-rich anorthosites."
187,187,Anorthosite conduit nickel-copper-PGE,"Anorthosite conduit nickel-copper-PGE deposits are also known as Anorthosite-granite-troctolite Ni-Cu-PGE. They belong to the general deposit group of Anorthosite conduit deposits. The deposit environment is typically Magmatic. Genetically related features of typical Anorthosite conduit nickel-copper-PGE deposits include: Convergent margin, late extension, intermediate (± granitic) dikes, sills, chonoliths.  Anorthosite conduit nickel-copper-PGE deposits are a distinct group of magmatic mineral deposits primarily associated with anorthositic rock complexes. These deposits are characterized by the presence of mafic to ultramafic intrusions containing significant concentrations of nickel, copper, and platinum-group elements (PGE). The primary host rocks are anorthosites and troctolites, occasionally interspersed with granitic and gabbroic components, reflecting a unique magmatic differentiation within a tectonic setting of convergent continental margins, often during late extensional phases. These deposits frequently form within conduits such as dikes, sills, and chonoliths, where magmatic processes concentrate these metals. Commodities typically include nickel and copper as major products, with PGEs like palladium and platinum serving as valuable by-products. The grade and tonnage can vary, but these deposits can reach economically viable concentrations due to the accumulation of dense sulfide liquids in the magma. Geologically, they manifest within Precambrian terranes, aligning with complex structural controls that influence the emplacement and localization of the deposits. The ore zones usually exhibit massive to disseminated sulfide mineralization, with magmatic sulfides such as pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and pyrrhotite being predominant. Alteration is generally minimal except for localized areas where secondary processes have remobilized ore constituents. Structurally, these deposits are often influenced by existing crustal weaknesses such as faults or shear zones, which guide the emplacement of the magmatic bodies. This structural control is critical in differentiating them from other magmatic deposit types that may form in more stable tectonic settings. The distinctive combination of geologic setting, host rock composition, and the often-complex magmatic processes involved make anorthosite conduit nickel-copper-PGE deposits unique, distinguishing them from other magmatic sulfide deposits associated with large igneous provinces or layered intrusions."
188,188,Impact U-M intrusion nickel-copper-PGE,"Impact U-M intrusion nickel-copper-PGE deposits are also known as Impact melt Ni-Cu-PGE. They belong to the general deposit group of Ultramafic and (or) mafic intrusion deposits. The deposit environment is typically Magmatic. Genetically related features of typical Impact U-M intrusion nickel-copper-PGE deposits include: Meteorite impact, ultramaficmafic magmatism.  Impact U-M intrusion nickel-copper-PGE deposits are uniquely characterized by their formation associated with meteorite impact events, which distinguish them from other ultramafic and mafic intrusions. The geological setting typically involves a crater formed by a large extraterrestrial impact, which leads to partial melting of the target rocks and the creation of impact melt sheets containing ultramafic to mafic compositions. These environments often produce differentiated igneous bodies with the potential to host significant mineralization of nickel, copper, and platinum group elements (PGE). The Sudbury Basin in Canada is the most renowned example of this deposit type, where the impact melt interacts with sulfide ores to enrich nickel and copper. The deposits are primarily magmatic-sulfide in nature with valuable commodities such as Ni, Cu, and PGEs occurring in massive to disseminated sulfide ore bodies, frequently dominated by pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite. The grades and tonnages vary, but Sudbury deposits exemplify significant volume with substantial metal concentrations, making them economically significant. Physically, these deposits can appear as large, irregularly shaped ore bodies often associated with breccias and varied textural domains. The age of mineralization correlates with known impact events, often situating these deposits in geological settings ranging from the Archean to the Proterozoic eons. Secondary alteration such as serpentinization can occur, but primary magmatic processes ubiquitously control the ore formation. Structural controls are primarily influenced by the shape of the impact crater and related deformation zones, frequently compounded by subsequent tectonic reworking. This deposit type is primarily situated in stable cratonic settings or postimpact tectonic basins and is distinguished by its genetic link to extraterrestrial impacts and association with unique melt-related features not commonly found in igneous-related mafic-ultramafic intrusion deposits."
189,189,Sand and gravel or stone quarry," Sand and gravel or stone quarry deposits represent significant geological resources primarily characterized by unconsolidated sedimentary materials or bedrock formations extracted for construction purposes. These deposits typically occur in river valleys, glacial terrains, or near ancient sea beds, with the primary rock types being sedimentary (such as sandstone and limestone), igneous (like granite), and metamorphic rocks (e.g., marble). The main commodities derived from these deposits include construction aggregates—sand, gravel, and crushed stone—essential for infrastructure and building materials. Unlike metallic mineral deposits, sand and gravel resources exhibit moderate tonnage and variable grade, often assessed by granule size, shape, and purity rather than metal content. Physiographically, they are found in areas with a significant history of sediment deposition and tectonic calm, favoring extensive flatland regions or gentle topographies where erosion and sediment transport prevail. These deposits lack complex alteration and orebody structures typical of metallic or hydrothermal mineralization, instead characterized by sorting and stratification due to water or ice movement. Ore control mechanisms include paleoenvironmental conditions and current geodynamic settings where aggregation and deposition processes occur. Key features distinguishing these quarry deposits from other mineral deposit types include their non-metallic nature, superficial depth, ease of extraction, and continuous regeneration in some cases due to ongoing sediment deposition. Tectonically, they are located in stable continental interiors or passive margins where major structural deformations are minimal. The age of mineralization is relatively young, often Quaternary or Tertiary, reflecting recent geological processes. Their significance lies in the widespread distribution and vital role in domestic and commercial building industries, emphasizing the economic rather than metallic value of the resource."
190,190,Geothermal energy plant," Geothermal energy plant type mineral deposits, often associated with the infrastructure and processes of geothermal energy production, exhibit unique geological features that differentiate them from traditional mineral deposits. These deposits are typically located in tectonically active regions, such as volcanic arcs, rift zones, or hotspots, where high heat flow enables the extraction of geothermal energy. The most significant rock types involved are volcanic rocks, including rhyolites, andesite, and basalts, as well as associated sedimentary and metamorphic formations. The primary ore types found in these settings include silica (often as amorphous silica or quartz), various sulfide minerals, and occasionally precious metals like gold and silver, deposited alongside geothermal fluids. Commodity types of interest can also include lithium and other critical elements that precipitate from geothermal brines. Geothermal deposits are characterized by relatively low-grade but substantial tonnage given their extensive surface and subsurface coverage. The physiography of these deposits often includes geothermal fields with hot springs, fumaroles, and geysers, evidencing surface manifestations of the underlying heat source. The age of mineralization in these deposits can range from recent to Quaternary, as these systems are often continuously active. Orebodies in geothermal systems tend to be stratiform or vein-like and may display significant hydrothermal alteration, typically silicification, argillic, or propylitic alterations. Ore control is primarily structural, dominated by fault and fracture networks that facilitate the ascent of geothermal fluids. The tectonic settings of these deposits are fundamentally linked to geodynamic environments conducive to elevated geothermal gradients, including divergent plate boundaries and subduction zones. These geologically dynamic regions provide the necessary conditions for sustainable geothermal energy exploitation, setting these mineral deposits apart from more static, traditional ore deposit environments."
191,191,Processing plant," It appears there might be some confusion in your request, as ""Processing plant deposits"" are not a recognized type of mineral deposit within geological and mineral exploration terminology. Instead, processing plants are industrial facilities where mined ore is crushed, ground, and processed to extract valuable minerals or metals. When exploring the geological features of mineral deposits that are typically processed in such plants, we refer to specific types of mineral deposits, such as porphyry copper deposits, epithermal gold-silver deposits, or massive sulfide deposits, each with distinct geological characteristics. For instance, porphyry copper deposits are large, low-grade deposits associated with intrusive igneous rocks, often found in convergent plate boundaries with significant hydrothermal alteration and distributed stockwork veins. They exhibit large tonnage but with variable copper grades, typically ranging from 0.2% to 1% Cu. In contrast, epithermal gold-silver deposits are formed at shallow depths in volcanic or geothermal settings and display high-grade veins often controlled by fault structures, with significant alteration halos including silicification and argillic alteration. The age of mineralization, tectonic settings, and controlling structures are critical in each deposit type's genesis, providing insights into their exploration. For instance, tectonic settings associated with island arcs or continental margins are critical for porphyry and epithermal deposits. These unique geological features determine the deposit's economic viability for mining and subsequent processing in a plant setting. To fully understand the nature of the deposits that a processing plant might handle, it's essential to focus on the specific deposit types in question and their unique geological traits, rather than looking for ""Processing plant deposits"" as a category."
