0,Residual placer tin,"Residual placer tin deposits are also known as Lag tin. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Residual placer tin deposits include: Chemical weathering, erosion of soft material, and concentration of resistate minerals in situ, preexisting mineralization. Residual placer tin deposits, commonly known as Lag tin deposits, are a unique form of placer deposits characterized by the in-situ concentration of tin-heavy minerals such as cassiterite, due to prolonged weathering and erosion processes. These deposits are essentially formed from the decomposition and erosion of primary tin-bearing rocks (typically granites, pegmatites, or metamorphic greisens), leaving behind the resistant and denser ore minerals like cassiterite in a concentrated state due to their relative stability against chemical weathering. Unlike alluvial placer deposits that are transported and sorted by water, residual placers remain at or near the site of the original mineralization, signifying their erosion-resistive nature. The grade and tonnage of these deposits can vary considerably but often present economically viable concentrations of tin, especially given the mechanical enrichment and minimal transport which preserves the ore quality. The age of mineralization in these settings can range significantly depending on the regional geological history, but the crucial factor is the period over which weathering processes took place. Tin grades in residual placers are often higher than those in alluvial settings, making them attractive mining targets. These deposits occur in regions with significant primary tin mineralization exposed to intense weathering environments, often within tropical or subtropical climates. Structurally, they require limited input, as the primary control is the presence of original tin mineralized zones and subsequent natural weathering processes rather than tectonic activities. Overall, the distinguishing feature of residual placer tin deposits lies in their formation process, where chemical stability and erosion resistance lead to natural enrichment directly at the source, rather than through fluvial transport and deposition.

1,Residual placer lead,"Residual placer lead deposits are also known as Lag lead. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Residual placer lead deposits include: Chemical weathering, erosion of soft material, and concentration of resistate minerals in situ, preexisting mineralization. Residual placer lead (Lag lead) deposits are distinguished from other mineral deposits by their formation process and environment, where lead minerals are concentrated through the chemical weathering and subsequent erosion of softer surrounding materials, leaving behind resistate minerals. These deposits are commonly found in regions characterized by significant ancient weathering profiles that are preserved, like those found in tableland or karst landscapes. The primary rock types involved are usually those containing pre-existing mineralizations, such as galena within carbonate rocks or old hydrothermal veins. The lead in residual placers can be found in the form of weathered remnants of the original lead-bearing minerals like cerussite (lead carbonate) which is formed from the oxidation of galena (PbS). The age of mineralization varies widely, but these deposits are often associated with stable tectonic settings with prolonged weathering periods, such as cratons or shield areas. Control on ore deposition in such settings is largely governed by topography and paleoclimate, which influence the erosion and preservation conditions essential for the formation of these deposits. This concentration mechanism does not typically produce extremely high-grade deposits, but the lead concentrations are economically viable due to the heavy and resistant nature of lead minerals in erosional environments. In summary, residual placer lead deposits offer a distinctive example of lead concentration through surface processes independent of the typical ore-forming hydrothermal mechanisms seen in many other mineral deposits.",Erosional,Placer
2,Fluvial placer gold,"Fluvial placer gold deposits are also known as Alluvial gold. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer gold deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization. Fluvial placer gold deposits, commonly referred to as alluvial gold deposits, are distinctive geological formations formed through the mechanical concentration of gold particles in river environments. These deposits are a subtype of placer deposits, where gold, due to its high density and resistance to weathering, accumulates in riverbeds, streambeds, and nearby alluvial plains. The gold in these deposits typically originates from the erosion of primary gold sources, such as quartz veins or other mineralized rock formations within the watershed. As these rocks undergo weathering, gold particles are liberated and transported downstream by water flow. The deposition is heavily influenced by changes in river velocity, where gold particles settle in areas of reduced flow, such as river bends and natural riffles. Distinguishing characteristics of fluvial placer gold deposits include their dependence on existing drainage networks, and topographic relief which facilitates the mechanical sorting necessary to concentrate the gold particles. The grade and tonnage of these deposits can vary significantly but are generally lower in grade with higher volume compared to hard rock gold sources. Importantly, these deposits do not require significant alteration or specific tectonic settings, distinguishing them from many other ore deposit types that depend heavily on specific geological and chemical processes for their formation.Fluvial placer gold type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39a.

Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer PGE deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization. Fluvial placer PGE (Platinum Group Elements) deposits, also termed Alluvial PGE deposits, are distinct mineral deposits set apart by their formation in river and stream environments where denser PGE minerals, derived from eroded primary sources like layered intrusions or ultramafic complexes, get mechanically concentrated by flowing water. These deposits predominantly form in regions featuring significant erosional processes, high topographic relief, and well-developed drainage systems that facilitate the physical sorting and deposition of heavy minerals in alluvial sediments. The primary rock types involved are typically igneous rocks rich in PGEs, such as those found in the Bushveld Complex or the Great Dyke, from where erosion liberates the PGEs. Unlike other deposits, where mineralization might be related to hydrothermal processes, fluvial placer deposits concentrate pre-existing minerals without chemical alteration. The ore types are generally clastic sediments consisting of sands and gravels enriched in PGEs. Grades and tonnages can vary significantly, but typically, the high density and resistivity to weathering of PGE minerals enable economically viable concentrations in placers. These deposits do not typically form distinct ore bodies but are instead characterized by diffuse horizons or paystreaks within broader alluvial fields, marked by a lack of significant alteration. The age of mineralization is closely tied to the timing of erosion and exhumation of the source rocks. In terms of tectonic settings, fluvial placer PGEs are often found in stable cratonic areas where long-term erosion exposes deep-seated PGE-rich rocks. The understanding of these deposits€™ physiography, sedimentology, and the specific conditions conducive to the concentration of heavy minerals is crucial for effective exploration and extraction of PGEs from these unique and economically important deposits.Fluvial placer PGE type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39b.

4,Fluvial placer tin,"Fluvial placer tin deposits are also known as Alluvial tin. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer tin deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization. Fluvial placer tin deposits, commonly referred to as alluvial tin deposits, are a unique type of mineral deposit found within river systems where tin, primarily in the form of cassiterite (SnO2), has been concentrated by the mechanical action of water. These deposits are typically located in regions of significant geological weathering and erosion, which liberates dense cassiterite grains from parent rock formations, often granitic intrusions rich in tin-bearing minerals. The liberated cassiterite is then transported and deposited by flowing water, accumulating in river bends, natural traps, and depressions where the water velocity decreases. Unlike many other mineral deposits, fluvial placer deposits do not require chemical alteration or extensive rock transformation, making them distinct in their formation processes which involves physical concentration mechanisms. The ore grades can vary widely but often are economically viable due to the high density and purity of cassiterite concentrates. These deposits are typically younger, geologically speaking, as they are often formed in Quaternary periods, coinciding with recent geological upheavals that create suitable erosional environments. The identification and exploitation of these deposits typically require understanding the current and historical geomorphology and hydrology of an area rather than the complex geochemical processes associated with other deposit types. This distinctive genesis and accumulation process sets fluvial placer tin deposits apart from other mineral deposits that often involve more complex formation mechanisms, such as hydrothermal or magmatic systems.Fluvial placer tin type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39e. Fluvial placer tin type mineral deposits are also known as Alluvial placer Sn. ",Erosional,Placer
5,Fluvial placer niobium-tantalum,"Fluvial placer niobium-tantalum deposits are also known as Alluvial niobium-tantalum. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer niobium-tantalum deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization. Fluvial placer niobium-tantalum deposits, categorized under the broader group of placer deposits, are unique concentrations of niobium (Nb) and tantalum (Ta) minerals that are typically found in river and stream sediments due to their high density and resistance to weathering. These deposits form as a result of erosion and subsequent transport from primary deposits, leading to the accumulation in fluvial environments with significant topographic relief and an established drainage network that facilitates the concentration of heavier minerals. Distinctive from other deposit types, fluvial placers are not associated with a specific rock type, but rather depend on the presence of Nb and Ta bearing minerals within eroded material, such as columbite-tantalite. Ore grades in these deposits can vary widely but are generally enriched in comparison to the original bedrock concentrations owing to natural sorting processes. The age of mineralization is primarily dependent on the timing of erosion and the exposure of pre-existing mineralized rocks. Key geological features influencing the formation include the structural control on the primary source rocks, changes in stream energy which promote deposition of heavy minerals, and minimal alteration processes due to the mechanical nature of ore transport and deposition. Tectonic settings influencing these deposits typically involve stable cratonic areas with ancient crystalline rocks or active orogenic belts where uplift and erosion expose and concentrate ore minerals in alluvial settings.",Erosional,Placer
6,Fluvial placer tungsten,"Fluvial placer tungsten deposits are also known as Alluvial tungsten. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer tungsten deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, preexisting mineralization. Fluvial placer tungsten deposits, characterized under the broader category of Placer deposits, are uniquely distinguished by their genesis in fluvial (river/stream) environments, where the mechanical concentration of heavy minerals from preexisting ore bodies occurs. These deposits primarily form in regions marked by significant exhumation and tectonic uplift, contributing to pronounced topographic relief and active drainage networks that facilitate the erosion and transport of resistant minerals like tungsten (typically wolframite and scheelite). The geologic setting typically includes Precambrian to Cenozoic age bedrock, rich in original tungsten-bearing veins or pegmatites. Unlike other placer deposits, which might concentrate lighter or more voluminous materials like gold or tin, fluvial placer tungsten deposits require catchment areas that were originally rich in tungsten minerals - the presence of old, hard rocks is thus a critical factor. The placer ores themselves are not significantly altered chemically but are mechanically sorted and rounded, gathering in crevices or natural traps within the riverbeds. Ore grades can be highly variable, largely depending on the original tungsten content in the source rocks and the efficiency of the fluvial system in concentrating the heavy minerals. These deposits do not typically form extensive ore bodies but occur as localized concentrations that can nonetheless be economically viable due to the high unit value of tungsten.",Erosional,Placer
7,Fluvial placer REE,"Fluvial placer REE deposits are also known as Alluvial REE. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer REE deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, specific rock types. Fluvial placer REE deposits, commonly known as alluvial REE deposits, are distinct within the broader category of placer deposits due to their unique depositional processes and geological settings. Characteristically formed in erosional environments, these deposits result from the mechanical concentration of heavy minerals by river and stream processes. The ore primarily accumulates in river channels, point bars, and alluvial fans where rapid sedimentation can trap denser minerals. Geologically, these deposits are often found in regions with significant topographic relief and strong erosion dynamics, which promote the weathering and release of rare earth elements (REEs) from source rocks like carbonatites and alkaline igneous complexes. REE-bearing minerals such as monazite, xenotime, and bastnÃ¤site are typically recovered, with the grade and tonnage varying significantly based on local geological conditions and the maturity of the placer. These deposits do not generally undergo any hydrothermal alteration, and their formation is largely controlled by the landscape's physiography and existing drainage networks. Fluvial placer REE deposits differ from other REE deposits like those derived hydrothermally or from ion adsorption clays, as they require no chemical alteration processes and are predominantly mechanically sorted. The tectonic setting is also crucial, often associated with active continental margins or rift settings where high rates of uplift and erosion prevail. This geological framework explains the typical concentration and preservation of REE-bearing minerals in fluvial placer settings, offering an economically viable, albeit variable, source of rare earth elements.",Erosional,Placer
8,Fluvial placer diamond,"Fluvial placer diamond deposits are also known as Alluvial diamond. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer diamond deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, kimberlite pipe. Fluvial placer diamond deposits, commonly referred to as alluvial diamonds, are a subtype of placer deposits formed in riverine environments. These deposits are characterized by diamonds that have been eroded from their primary source, typically kimberlite pipes, and then transported by rivers or streams. The significant geological features of these deposits include their occurrence in areas with high topographic relief and active drainage networks, which facilitate the erosion and transport of diamond-bearing materials. The diamonds are found within sediments like sand and gravel in riverbeds, terraces, or alluvial fans, making sedimentological processes pivotal in their concentration. Unlike other mineral deposits, fluvial placer diamonds do not involve a specific host rock but are concentrated by physical processes, including sorting and density separation, driven by water flow. Typically, these deposits are younger, Quaternary in age, due to their association with recent geological surface processes. The grade and tonnage of these deposits can vary significantly but generally have higher diamond concentrations compared to other sedimentary environments due to natural sorting mechanisms. The key to the economic viability of fluvial placer deposits is their enrichment factor and the preservation of depositional environments that prevent dispersion of diamonds. This distinct formation and occurrence settings make fluvial placer diamond deposits unique compared to other types of mineral deposits which are often defined by chemical processes and specific host rocks or ore bodies.",Erosional,Placer
9,Fluvial placer gemstones,"Fluvial placer gemstones deposits are also known as Alluvial gemstones. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer gemstones deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, specific rock type. Fluvial placer gemstone deposits, commonly termed alluvial gemstones, represent a distinctive class of mineral deposits primarily formed in river and stream systems where valuable gemstones are mechanically concentrated by water action. These deposits are sourced from weathered parental rocks with gemstones subsequently trapped within riverbeds, floodplains, or alluvial fans due to their higher density and resistance to weathering. Typical gemstones found in these deposits include diamonds, sapphires, rubies, and gold. The process of formation is largely dependent on high-energy environments capable of transporting and concentrating the heavier minerals while dispersing the lighter matrix. Key geological features include significant secondary enrichment zones, where gemstones accumulate in potholes or behind natural riffles, providing natural sorting mechanisms. These deposits are typically unconsolidated, consisting of sands, gravels, and other detrital material. The fluvial placer context is crucially influenced by factors such as the presence of certain durable rock types in the source area, like kimberlite or lamproite for diamonds, and basaltic or metamorphic terrains for sapphires and rubies. Age of mineralization in these deposits spans a wide range, often aligned with periods of intense erosion and sedimentation associated with climatic and tectonic shifts. This type of deposit does not typically undergo significant metamorphic or hydrothermal alteration, distinguishing it from many other ore deposit types that involve more complex geological processes for ore formation. Fluvial placer deposits are hence differentiated by their simplicity of formation, the physical rather than chemical properties of the ores, and their direct link to erosion and sedimentary processes.Fluvial placer gemstones type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39d.

10,Fluvial placer garnet,"Fluvial placer garnet deposits are also known as Alluvial garnet. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Fluvial placer garnet deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, specific rock type. Fluvial placer garnet deposits, commonly known as alluvial garnet deposits, are a subtype of placer deposits characterized by the accumulation of garnet minerals in river and stream sediments. These deposits are typically found where erosional processes expose garnet-bearing metamorphic or igneous rocks such as schists, gneisses, or granites. As these rocks are weathered and eroded, garnets are released and transported downstream, accumulating in areas where the river's energy decreases, allowing heavier minerals to settle. Garnets in these deposits are primarily of the almandine-pyrope varieties, valued both as gemstones and industrial abrasives. The geological settings of fluvial placer garnet deposits often involve high topographic relief which facilitates the erosion and transportation processes necessary for placer formation. Unlike other mineral deposits, which might be defined by in situ mineralization processes, fluvial placer deposits are mechanically concentrated by natural hydraulics without chemical alteration processes influencing the deposition. Key geological features influencing these deposits include rock type, ancient fluvial systems, and regional tectonic setting that controls the original garnet rock source and subsequent erosional-exhumational histories. These deposits do not generally present high tonnage but can yield high grades of garnet concentrates in localized zones, distinguished by their relatively simple exploration and extraction techniques. Their occurrence is broadly tied to regions with a history of orogenic activity, which is responsible for the formation of the source rocks and the dynamic tectonic processes that lead to significant erosional patterns essential for placer formation.Fluvial placer garnet type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39g.

11,Heavy mineral sands,"Heavy mineral sands deposits are also known as Mineral sands. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Heavy mineral sands deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, delta, shoreline, barrier island, specific rock types. Heavy mineral sands deposits, a significant type of Placer deposits, are predominantly found in coastal environments where ancient beach and river systems have concentrated dense minerals like ilmenite, rutile, zircon, monazite, and sometimes gold through hydraulic and gravitational sorting processes. Typically forming in regions with an abundance of erosion-resistant source rocks, such as igneous or metamorphic rocks rich in heavy minerals, these deposits are unique in their composition and modes of accumulation. The ore bodies are usually stratiform, laying parallel to the ancient shorelines or river channels, and are essentially free from any metamorphic or hydrothermal alteration, reflecting their mechanical origin and accumulation instead. The age of mineralization is relatively young, often Quaternary, due to the recent nature of depositional processes. A key factor in their formation involves the initial erosion that liberates mineral grains followed by coastline or fluvial transportation and subsequent deposition in traps created by sea-level changes, tides, or other littoral processes. Typically devoid of any significant tectonic structures, their distribution often aligns with passive continental margins and stable tectonic settings. Heavy mineral sands are distinct in their high grades of economically important minerals like titanium (from ilmenite and rutile) and zirconium (from zircon), offering an essential resource for various industrial applications in a relatively accessible form.Heavy mineral sands type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39c.

12,Shoreline placer gold,"Shoreline placer gold deposits are also known as Beach placer gold. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Shoreline placer gold deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, delta, shoreline, barrier island, pre-existing mineralization. Shoreline placer gold deposits, prominently found along coastal areas where ancient beach environments have preserved the deposits, are distinctively characterized by their unique settings and mechanism of gold concentration. These deposits are formed from the mechanical sorting and accumulation of heavier minerals like gold by wave and tidal actions, which segregate them from lighter, less dense materials. The ore typically comprises fine to very fine particles of gold, often found with other heavy minerals like ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite. These placers can vary widely in grade and tonnage, with some historical operations reporting grades ranging from 0.5 grams to several grams per ton, with variable tonnage dependent on the extent and thickness of the placer deposits. Geologically, these deposits do not require a host rock but develop in quaternary sediments such as sands and gravels. The age of mineralization is generally young, primarily Quaternary, linked closely with the last glacial and interglacial periods which influenced sea levels and shoreline configurations. Key geological features influencing the formation of shoreline placer deposits include pre-existing mineralization sources upstream, paleo-shoreline trajectories, and modern erosional processes. Unlike other placer deposits like alluvial placers, shoreline placers are controlled strictly by marine processes and the configuration of historical shorelines rather than fluvial mechanics. The unique setting in active or passive continental margins with a history of fluctuating sea levels makes the shoreline placers a distinctive system where the ore control is largely governed by ancient tidal ranges and wave energy rather than typical fluvial stream gradients and basin configurations found in non-marine placer settings.",Erosional,Placer
13,Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands,"Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands deposits are also known as Lithified mineral sands; indurated mineral sands. They belong to the general deposit group of Placer deposits. The deposit environment is typically Erosional. Genetically related features of typical Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, delta, shoreline, barrier island, specific rock types. Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands deposits, which are lithified remnants of ancient placer accumulations, distinguish themselves significantly from other mineral deposit types through their unique geological formations and composition. Typically found in erosional environments, these deposits consist primarily of dense, resistant minerals such as zircon, ilmenite, rutile, and in some cases, monazite and gold, concentrated by wave and wind action on ancient beach fronts and shoreline systems. The process of lithification hardens these former loose sands into rock, preserving the high-grade heavy mineral layers that are key economic targets in mining. The deposits are often hosted in specific rock types, including quartz sands that have been cemented by silica, carbonate, or other minerals during diagenesis. The stratigraphic control reflects the original sedimentary layering, which corresponds with changes in sea level and the progradation of shorelines, tightly linked to glacial and interglacial cycles. These deposits can be ancient, often dating back to the Precambrian or Paleozoic eras, thereby giving a good clue on the age of mineralization. Moreover, the presence of stable cratonic regions and passive margin settings are common tectonic environments for these deposits. Unlike many hydrothermal deposits, Paleoplacer deposits are not associated with significant alteration or mineralized veins but are defined by their sedimentological context and the mechanical concentration of minerals over time. This makes them particularly distinct in terms of exploration and extraction, focusing primarily on the sedimentary history and the present physiography to guide mineral recovery.Paleoplacer heavy mineral sands type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39c.

Genetically related features of typical Paleoplacer tin deposits include: Exhumation, topographic relief, drainage network, delta, shoreline, barrier island, specific rock types. Paleoplacer tin deposits, categorized under the broader group of Placer deposits, are distinctive due to their specific geological settings and genesis processes. Characteristically found in environments where ancient erosional and depositional mechanisms have acted, these deposits are fundamentally linked to the exhumation of source areas and subsequent sedimentary reworking in regions with notable topographic relief and robust drainage networks. The ore primarily comprises mechanically concentrated tin minerals, such as cassiterite, enriched in ancient river channels, deltas, shorelines, and barrier islands. The rock types associated with these deposits frequently include quartz-rich sandstones and conglomerates that capture and preserve the dense, resistant cassiterite grains during sedimentary processes. Paleoplacer tin deposits are typically older, often dating back to Proterozoic to Paleozoic eras, which distinguishes them temporally from other placer deposits formed in more recent geological times. These deposits showcase lower average ore grades but can have substantial tonnage due to the extensive nature of sedimentary systems. Ore control is predominantly governed by paleogeography and the original depositional environment, which orchestrated the placer's concentration and preservation dynamics. Unlike hydrothermal tin deposits, paleoplacers lack significant alteration halos, with the primary geological processes involving physical weathering and sorting rather than chemical changes. This specific combination of old age, sedimentary environment, and ore concentration by physical processes sets Paleoplacer tin deposits apart from other mineral deposit types.Paleoplacer tin type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 39e.

Paleoplacer gold ± uranium deposits, also known as Quartz pebble conglomerate Au-U deposits, represent a distinct type of mineral deposit characterized by their occurrence in ancient fluvial sedimentary environments, typically from the Precambrian era. These deposits consist primarily of mature quartz pebble conglomerates and quartzites that have been cemented by silica, with gold and uranium occurring as disseminations within the matrix or on grain boundaries. The unique geological setting includes ancient river channels and deltaic systems where heavy minerals were concentrated by gravity separation during sediment transport and deposition. Typically, these deposits show minimal to no metamorphism, preserving the original sedimentary structures, which is critical for the placement and preservation of the mineralization. The gold found in these deposits is often very fine-grained and occurs alongside other heavy minerals such as uraninite or thorianite, which provide the uranium content. Importantly, these deposits are often large and low-grade, but their extensive size can make them economically viable. The ore control and distribution within these deposits are primarily influenced by the paleogeography and sedimentary processes, with mineralization typically stratabound and syn-sedimentary. This type of deposit is distinct from other placer or hydrothermal deposits due to its ancient age, sedimentary origin, and the association of gold with uranium, offering unique exploration and extraction challenges.Paleoplacer gold ± uranium type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 29a.

Genetically related features of typical Bauxite deposits include: Stable area with low relief, tropical climate, Al-bearing rock types, unsaturated zone, water table. Bauxite deposits, distinctively recognized as the primary source of aluminum, revolve around the geological context of lateritization processes under tropical to subtropical climate conditions. These deposits mainly derive from the intensive weathering of aluminum-rich parent rocks such as basalt, granite, or various types of sedimentary clays, facilitating the accumulation of hydrated aluminum oxides - predominantly gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspore. A critical element distinguishing bauxite from other ore deposits is its formation in stable tectonic environments with low topographic relief, where prolonged exposure to chemical weathering can occur undisturbed. Typically, bauxite deposits do not form deeply buried ore bodies but instead are stratiform or pisolitic near the surface, influencing easier mining operations. The grade of bauxite is chiefly determined by the concentration of Al2O3, usually averaging about 30-60% in most economic deposits, with other commodities like Fe, Ti, and Si present as impurities that can affect the refinement process. Structurally, these deposits lack significant deformation and are generally found at or near the surface, often capped by lateritic iron crusts which serve as a protective layer preventing further erosion of the underlying bauxite. Bauxite deposits seldom encompass the complexities of metamorphic or hydrothermal processes, placing them geologically as one of the most straightforward, yet economically crucial, mineral deposits, specifically tailored for large-scale aluminum production.Bauxite type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 38b.

Karst bauxite deposits, predominantly found in stable regions with carbonate rock foundations, are a specific type of laterite deposit where the formation environment is characterized by intense weathering under tropical climates. These deposits form as aluminum-bearing rocks undergo supergene alteration processes atop limestone or dolomite, gaining significances through the dissolution of carbonate rocks and residual enrichment of aluminum oxides. Ore bodies typically present in pisolitic or oolitic forms, with commodities chiefly consisting of aluminum in the form of minerals like gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspora. These deposits are significant for their high grades of bauxite, often yielding large tonnages of ore suitable for aluminum production. Unique to karst bauxite deposits is their physiography, usually forming in areas of low relief near the water table, which influences the leaching and accumulation of ores. The age of mineralization typically aligns with the stability and exposure duration of the host rocks, varying widely from Tertiary to recent times. Structurally, these deposits lack significant deformation, residing in tectonically stable settings absent of pronounced faulting or folding, which distinguishes them from bauxite deposits associated with high-energy tectonic environments like those formed in sedimentary basins or volcanic arcs. The peculiarities of their development in karstified landscapes, enabling focused lateral and vertical ore enrichment, mark their distinction among the broader category of bauxite mineral deposits.Karst bauxite type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 38c.

Genetically related features of typical Laterite nickel deposits include: Stable area with low relief, tropical climate, ultramafic rocks, unsaturated zone, water table. Laterite nickel deposits, forming under specific climatic and geological settings, are critical sources of nickel and cobalt. These deposits typically develop in regions with a tropical climate where prolonged weathering of ultramafic rocks occurs under conditions of high rainfall and temperature. This weathering process leads to the intense leaching of silicate minerals, resulting in the accumulation of iron oxides, nickel, and cobalt in the soil profile. The rock types involved are primarily serpentinites, dunites, or peridotites that originate from the Earth's mantle. Ore types in these deposits are predominantly limonitic (rich in iron oxides) and saprolitic (clay-rich), with the saprolite being the primary target for nickel mining due to its higher nickel content. Typically, the nickel grades range from 0.8 to 2.5%, with certain deposits also containing appreciable amounts of cobalt. Deposits form in stable tectonic settings on cratonic blocks or on passive continental margins, where minimal tectonic disturbances allow for the prolonged weathering necessary to form these ores. The age of mineralization is predominantly linked to the weathering processes during the Tertiary or later. Physiographically, these deposits coincide with low-relief landscapes which facilitate the accumulation and preservation of lateritic profiles. The distinct high iron content, alongside the specific environmental and geological conditions needed for their formation, sets laterite nickel deposits apart from other types of mineral deposits.Laterite nickel type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 38a.

Genetically related features of typical Carbonatite laterite REE deposits include: Stable area with low relief, tropical climate, carbonatites, unsaturated zone, water table. Carbonatite laterite REE deposits represent a unique subclass of laterite deposits characterized by the weathering of carbonatite rocks, which are uncommon igneous rocks composed predominantly of carbonate minerals. These deposits are formed in a distinct supragene environment where extensive chemical weathering occurs under tropical climates with high rainfall and temperature. The process liberates rare earth elements (REEs) from carbonatite, accumulating them along with residual clays and iron oxides in the laterite profile. The carbonatites involved are usually Proterozoic to Cenozoic in age, forming in stable tectonic settings with low relief. This geological setup ensures minimal topographical changes, allowing prolonged weathering and ore concentration. The ore bodies in carbonatite laterite REE deposits typically exhibit variably enriched grades of light and heavy REEs, with the concentration largely depending on the original composition of the carbonatite and the efficiency of the lateritization process. The localized ore control in these deposits is primarily governed by the original morphology and composition of the carbonatite bodies, with enriched zones often correlating with structural features such as faults or fractures that facilitate fluid access and encourage alteration. This type of deposit is distinct from other REE and laterite deposits, which may derive from different parent rocks under varying climatic and tectonic conditions, emphasizing the unique combination of carbonatites and tropical weathering in generating economically important REE resources.Carbonatite laterite REE type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 10.

These deposits typically form in regions with stable tectonic settings and low relief, under a tropical climate that promotes intense chemical weathering and leaching necessary for laterite formation. The predominant rock type associated with these deposits is carbonatite, which provides the initial source of magnesium. During the weathering process, magnesium is leached from the carbonatite and reprecipitated as magnesite (MgCO‚ƒ) in the unsaturated zones above the water table. This leads to the development of ore bodies predominantly made up of secondary magnesite. These deposits often feature lower grades but can achieve substantial tonnage, making them economically viable. Distinct from other ore deposit types, their ore control largely depends on the availability of precursor rocks rich in magnesium and the extent of lateritic weathering rather than structural controls or depth-based zonation typical of hydrothermal systems. The age of mineralization is generally tied to the timing of lateritic weathering conditions, which can vary geographically and historically. Laterite magnesite deposits are thus primarily differentiated from other deposit types by their reliance on surface weathering processes and the geochemical environment rather than hydrothermal activity or structural mechanics common in many other mineral deposits.",Supergene,Laterite
21,Residual clay,"Residual clay deposits are also known as Secondary clay. They belong to the general deposit group of Clay deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Residual clay deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, Al-bearing rock types, water table. Residual clay deposits, often referred to as secondary clays, are distinct geological formations resulting from the intensive weathering of parent rock under specific climatic conditions. Typically found in a supragene environment, these deposits are fundamentally linked to regions where chemical weathering€”prominent in a variable climate zone€”leaches primary minerals leaving behind an accumulation of clays. The primary rock types involved are usually aluminum-bearing silicates, such as feldspars and micas, which upon weathering form secondary clay minerals like kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite. Unlike sedimentary clays which are transported and deposited, residual clays are notable for their in-situ formation right above the parent rock. This unique mode of formation often results in high-purity clay deposits that are economically significant. The physiography generally includes relatively flat to gently undulating terrain, facilitating extensive weathering without significant erosion of the formed clay. Ore control in these deposits is largely governed by the extent and depth of weathering, with the water table acting as a chemical barrier. These deposits do not typically form in any specific tectonic setting, but are more related to climatic stability and rock chemistry over geologic time frames. Residual clay deposits are essential sources of clay for ceramics and brick industries, among other uses, their value often tied to their purity and specific mineralogical composition.",Supergene,Clay
22,"Underclay, overclay","Underclay, over-clay deposits are also known as Gob. They belong to the general deposit group of Clay deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Underclay, over-clay deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, Al-or REE-bearing shales adjacent to coal seams, water table. Underclay and over-clay deposits, commonly referred to as gob, are distinctive mineral deposits primarily associated with coal-bearing sequences. These deposits form in the supragene environment, where alteration occurs near the surface influenced by meteoric waters and variable climatic conditions. Underclays are paleosols that developed beneath coal seams, indicating a period of stability and soil formation prior to subsequent coal deposition. These clays often contain significant amounts of kaolinite, illite, and smectite. Over-clay, conversely, forms above the coal seam and may include similar mineralogical compositions. The uniqueness of these deposits lies partly in their relationship with surrounding rock types, particularly Al- or REE-bearing shales and the proximal coal seams. Commonly occurring in regions with marked seasonality and varying water tables, these deposits do not typically host metallic ores but are valued for their industrial minerals, particularly clays for ceramics and brick manufacturing. Geologically, these deposits might not present high-grade or high-tonnage ore compared to metallic mineral deposits, but their economic value is enhanced by their utility in various industrial applications. Their formation is tied to the geologic periods of extensive coal formation, and they are often found in settings with significant sedimentary structuring, influenced by regional tectonics that controlled the deposition of coal and associated clays. This relationship between coal and clay, along with the specific environmental conditions of formation, distinguishes underclay and over-clay deposits from other mineral deposit types.Underclay, overclay type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 38i. Underclay, overclay type mineral deposits are also known as Fireclay. ",Supergene,Clay
23,Ion adsorption REE,"Ion adsorption REE deposits belong to the general deposit group of Clay deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Ion adsorption REE deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, Al-or REE-bearing granitic, peralkaline, or carbonatite rocks, water table. Ion adsorption rare earth element (REE) deposits, predominantly found in southern China, are distinct due to their formation in lateritic terrains derived from the intense weathering of granitic, peralkaline, or carbonatite parent rocks under tropical to subtropical climates. These deposits are characterized by low-grade, bulk-tonnage REE ores that are economically viable due to the minimal processing required to extract REEs from adsorption clays. Typically, these deposits do not involve concentrated minerals but rather REEs adsorbed onto the surface of clay minerals within the weathered crust. The geology typically involves an unsaturated clay zone rich in aluminum or REEs, lying above a granitic bedrock, often influenced by a near-surface water table which affects the mobility and concentration of REEs. The ages of these deposits are generally aligned with the timing of intensive weathering processes in the Cenozoic, given that REE mobilization and enrichment are controlled by climatic conditions and subsequent leaching and deposition in residual soils. Ion adsorption deposits are commonly found in rolling to hilly topographies, with extensive lateritization providing the necessary conditions for REE enrichment through supergene processes. This type of deposit contrasts with hard-rock deposits, where REEs are typically hosted within accessory minerals like monazite and bastnaesite in igneous or metamorphic rocks, requiring more complex and costly processing techniques to extract REEs.",Supergene,Clay
24,Supergene silver,"Supergene silver deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene silver deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting Ag-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene silver deposits are characteristic secondary mineral deposits formed near the earth's surface due to the weathering of underlying primary Ag-rich orebodies. These deposits are typically situated in regions where climatic conditions promote extensive leaching and oxidation. Key to the formation of these deposits is the existence of a preexisting Ag-rich mineralization, which undergoes alteration when exposed to meteoric waters and oxygen at and below the water table within the unsaturated zone. The leached silver re-precipitates in enriched zones, often forming ores with higher silver grades compared to the primary mineralization. The rock types hosting these deposits vary but often include fractured or permeable rocks which facilitate fluid movement and mineral deposition. Commodity types predominantly feature silver, sometimes associated with other base metals like copper or lead due to the complex geochemical mobility during weathering. Physiographically, these deposits occur in varied settings from flat basins to mountainous terrains, with the age of mineralization spanning from ancient to more recent geological periods. Structural controls such as faults and fractures play crucial roles in localizing ore fluids and facilitating the formation of ore bodies. Unlike other deposits, the distinguishing feature of supergene silver deposits is their dependency on surface or near-surface processes and existing mineralization rather than the formation environment itself, making them unique in aspects of genesis, localized geological settings, and often, higher ore grades.",Supergene,Supergene
25,Supergene lead,"Supergene lead deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene lead deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting Pb-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene lead deposits are a distinct category of mineral deposits formed through the processes of weathering and leaching in near-surface environments, typically characterized by the oxidation and remobilization of pre-existing primary lead (Pb) mineralization. These deposits are commonly found in regions where the climate facilitates significant leaching and transportation of ions in groundwater, aiding the formation of secondary ores in the unsaturated zone above the water table. The orebodies in supergene lead deposits are generally enriched in lead minerals, particularly anglesite (PbSO4) and cerussite (PbCO3), which precipitate closer to the surface as more soluble components are leached away. Host rock types generally include carbonate rocks, shales, or sandstones that originally contained disseminated galena (PbS) or other lead-bearing minerals. Supergene lead deposits are notably smaller and less tonnage-heavy compared to major Pb-Zn sulfide deposits yet can have high grades of lead, often associated with silver (Ag) credits. These features are controlled by the physiography of the terrain, including permeability and rock porosity which influence fluid flow paths. Structurally, these deposits may also be influenced by faults and fractures which can act as conduits for fluid flow, further catalyzing the leaching and precipitation processes. The distinct geochemical environment required for supergene alteration and the typically younger geological age of mineralization compared to primary lead deposits offer important distinguishing factors for these deposits.",Supergene,Supergene
26,Supergene uranium,"Supergene uranium deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene uranium deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting U-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene uranium deposits are characterized primarily by their formation through the alteration and enrichment processes occurring near the Earth's surface, with environmental factors and meteoric waters playing crucial roles. These deposits often originate where pre-existing primary uranium minerals, typically hosted in various rock types such as sandstones or conglomerates, undergo oxidative dissolution when exposed to oxygenated groundwater. This leads to the migration and secondary precipitation of uranium, forming distinct mineral zones at or below the water table. Key ore minerals in these deposits are often secondary uranium oxides, such as uraninite and coffinite. The physiographical setting is typically variable, but these deposits often occur in regions with significant relief that facilitates groundwater movement and oxidation. Ore grades can vary widely but are generally high compared to primary uranium deposits, making these economical in certain contexts. The age of mineralization can span a broad range, typically postdating the host rock deposition by a considerable interval. Features like peneconcordant and discordant orebodies are observed, with alteration zones marked by a depletion of sulfides and enrichment in iron oxides. Key genetic and structural elements include the presence of unconformities, faults, or fractures that serve as conduits for fluid flow, essential for ore concentration. Consequently, these deposits are distinct from other uranium deposit types by their reliance on surface or near-surface chemical processes and dynamic hydrogeological regimes.",Supergene,Supergene
27,Supergene vanadium,"Supergene vanadium deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene vanadium deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting V-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene vanadium deposits are a distinct type of mineral deposits formed through the chemical alteration and enrichment of pre-existing vanadium-rich mineralization within the unsaturated and weathering zones near the water table, particularly under varying climatic conditions. These deposits are typically characterized by the secondary enrichment of vanadium as a result of leaching from upper oxidized portions of an ore body and subsequent precipitation in reduced zones, leading to high-grade ore zones compared to primary deposits. The host rocks for these deposits predominantly include sandstones, shales, and carbonates, which are initially enriched in vanadium-bearing minerals like vanadiferous titanomagnetite. The alteration processes involved often lead to the formation of secondary minerals such as vanadium oxides and hydroxides. Physiographically, these deposits are usually found in regions with moderate to high relief conducive to effective meteoric water circulation, essential for the oxidation and mobilization of vanadium. The tectonic settings can vary, though they often occur in stable continental environments devoid of intense orogenic activities. Unlike hydrothermal vanadium deposits, which are directly linked with magmatic activities, supergene vanadium deposits rely significantly on surface weathering processes and the presence of a previously mineralized source rock, hence making them unique in their genesis and locality.",Supergene,Supergene
28,Supergene gold,"Supergene gold deposits are also known as Regolith gold. They belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene gold deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting Au-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene gold deposits, also known as Regolith gold, form through secondary enrichment processes that occur near the Earth's surface, influenced by atmospheric, biological, and surface chemical conditions. These deposits typically develop where preexisting Au-rich primary mineralization interacts with meteoric waters within the unsaturated zone just above the water table. Chemically, gold is mobilized in low-temperature conditions through oxidation of primary sulfide minerals, and then precipitated from solution, often at redox boundaries or in areas where changes in pH or chemical composition occurs. Supergene gold deposits are distinguished by their formation in variable climatic settings, ranging from arid to tropical, which significantly influences the oxidation rates and the type of alteration. The host rocks are generally highly weathered, encompassing a wide variety of lithologies that originally contained hypogene gold mineralization. The gold ores in these deposits can show significant heterogeneity in grade, commonly occurring in lower grades than primary deposits; however, the mineralization can be rich and concentrated locally. Another distinguishing feature is the age of mineralization which generally correlates with the timing of surface exposure and weathering rather than the age of the host rocks. This process results in distinct geomorphological features that include deep regolith profiles and lateritic caps. Structures such as faults and fractures often play a critical role in controlling the localization of ore, acting as conduits for fluid movement. The physiography typically features gentle slopes and mature terrain, aiding in the extensive development of these deposits under prevailing climatic conditions. Supergene gold deposits are of great economic interest due to their near-surface nature, which often makes them easier and less expensive to exploit despite their generally lower grades compared to primary deposits.",Supergene,Supergene
29,Supergene zinc,"Supergene zinc deposits are also known as Non-sulfide Zn, oxi-dized Zn (Pb). They belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene zinc deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting Zn-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene zinc deposits, distinguished within the broader category of Supergene ore deposits, characterize a transformation from primary sulfide minerals to secondary non-sulfide zinc ores, most notably smithsonite (ZnCO3), hemimorphite (Zn4Si2O7(OH)2·H2O), and hydrozincite (Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6). These secondary ores typically result from the weathering of pre-existing zinc-rich sulfide mineral beds such as sphalerite under conditions where the local environment has oxidized these into economically relevant concentrations of non-sulfides. This mineral enrichment often occurs under a variable climate regime, particularly within regions where a marked dry season facilitates enhanced oxidation and leaching by percolating meteoric waters, shaping both the depth and morphology of the ore body within the generally flat or gently undulating landscapes. The genesis of these deposits is closely related to the interaction between geological features like the water table, exposure at surface, and the presence of an unsaturated zone that enhances the oxidizing conditions. Crucially, these deposits do not require extensive igneous activity or metamorphism, distancing them from other zinc deposit types like VMS or SEDEX, which are typically tied to specific tectonic settings or hydrothermal processes. The typical age of the mineralization process in Supergene zinc deposits spans from recent to millions of years, indicating a prolonged and ongoing formation timeline potentially yielding variable yet often high-grade ore, with tonnages that can be significantly economically exploited.",Supergene,Supergene
30,Supergene copper,"Supergene copper deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene copper deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting Cu-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene copper deposits, a significant class of mineral deposits, form through the secondary enrichment process where pre-existing hypogene (primary) sulfide mineralization, typically confined in porphyry copper deposits, is leached by meteoric waters in a predominantly unsaturated zone above the water table. The leaching process typically takes place in variable climates but is predominant in regions with significant wet and dry seasonal variations, enhancing the oxidation and subsequent enrichment of the ore beneath an oxidized cap. These deposits are notable for their high-grade copper ore, often found as chalcocite and native copper, against lower-grade porphyry copper sulfides like chalcopyrite. The transitions are marked by a distinctive gossan or an iron cap of oxidized minerals such as goethite or hematite above the enriched copper zone. The physiography typically involves copper-bearing geological structures located in areas of significant tectonic activity; faults and fractures play a crucial role in controlling the percolation of fluids, thereby defining the orebody geometry and extent of mineralization. Dating of supergene processes is usually much younger than the host rocks, occurring mainly in the Tertiary to recent periods, reflecting the relative timing of uplifting, erosion, and exposure to surface processes. This tectonically active setting distinguishes them from purely sedimentary or hydrothermal deposits. The unique combination of high-grade copper enrichment and secondary geological processes, facilitated by specific structural and climatic conditions, sets supergene copper deposits apart from other mineral deposit types.",Supergene,Supergene
31,Supergene manganese,"Supergene manganese deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene manganese deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting Mn-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene manganese deposits are distinguished primarily by their formation in the near-surface environment, where chemical weathering and remobilization occur under the influence of meteoric waters and organic activity. These deposits are typically enriched above preexisting manganese-rich protores, such as sedimentary manganese layers or residual accumulations from older, hypogene mineralization phases. The alteration in supergene environments leads to the formation of various manganese oxides, including pyrolusite, psilomelane, and manganite, which replace or encrust the original manganese-bearing minerals. The mineralization usually occurs in regions with considerable variation in climate, particularly where episodic exposure to oxidizing conditions through fluctuating water tables can escalate manganese concentration. Ore grades can be significantly high, though the tonnage may vary widely. These deposits form predominantly in continental settings with relatively stable tectonic environments, which facilitate prolonged weathering processes. Geological controls such as the permeability of the host rocks and the presence of structural features like fractures and faults can influence the depth and concentration of the mineralization. Physiographically, supergene manganese deposits are found in both flat and hilly terrains that allow for effective leaching and deposition processes. Such conditions and processes are distinctly different from marine sedimentary deposits or those formed from hydrothermal solutions, marking the supergene manganese deposits with unique geological and geochemical signatures necessary for targeted exploration and exploitation.",Supergene,Supergene
32,Supergene iron,"Supergene iron deposits belong to the general deposit group of Supergene deposits. The deposit environment is typically Supergene. Genetically related features of typical Supergene iron deposits include: Variable climate, unsaturated zone, preexisting Fe-rich mineralization, water table. Supergene iron deposits, a subset of Supergene mineral deposits, form through the secondary alteration and enrichment processes primarily under the influence of meteoric waters and prevailing climatic conditions that alter pre-existing hypogene iron-rich mineralization. These deposits typically occur near the surface, facilitated by the oxidation of iron-bearing minerals in the zone above the water table in variable climates. Key features include highly oxidized ores often dominated by goethite, hematite, and occasionally magnetite remnants from original iron formations like BIFs (banded iron formations). The alteration is characterized by a significant increase in ore grade through the leaching of non-iron elements and subsequent concentration of iron, often resulting in high-grade iron ores, with some deposits reporting iron content over 60%. These processes occur predominantly in regions with active weathering, reliant on the landscape's physiography which aids in the movement of oxidizing solutions. Structurally, ore bodies are often stratabound with significant alterations extending from original ore margins and controlled by permeability enhancements along faults and fractures. The tectonic settings vary, but these deposits commonly reside in stable continental shields or cratons characterized by aged geological features. Supergene iron deposits are distinguishable from others by their formation process predominantly above the water table, leading to distinctively high-grade and economically significant iron resources even in relatively small-tonnage occurrences.",Supergene,Supergene
33,Exotic copper,"Exotic copper deposits are also known as Paleochannel copper. They belong to the general deposit group of Exotic deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Exotic copper deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, aquifers, preexisting Cu mineralization, redox interface. Exotic copper deposits, often referred to as Paleochannel copper deposits, are unique among mineral deposits due to their formation process and settings. These deposits originate predominantly from the infiltration of surface waters rich in copper, which leach copper from primary mineralization zones and redeposit it in porous sedimentary rocks, such as sandstones and conglomerates, often aligned with ancient river channels (paleochannels). The orebody formation is largely controlled by the redox interface where the oxidized, copper-bearing fluids encounter a reducing environment conducive to copper precipitation. This process results in the disposition of chalcocite as the dominant copper sulfide mineral, differentiating it from other deposit types, which may also contain significant quantities of chalcopyrite or bornite. Exotic copper deposits are typically characterised by lower-grade copper ore, but the considerable tonnages can make them economically viable. These deposits are generally younger, forming in Neogene or Quaternary periods, under conditions driven by recent tectonic or climatic events, making their physiography, primarily flat or gently undulating terrain, significant for their identification. Their occurrence is particularly noted within arid to semi-arid regions where limited vegetation and surface water promote the necessary geochemical processes at or near the surface. The limited scope of alteration and simple ore controls associated with exotic copper deposits underscore their distinctiveness from more complex porphyry or sediment-hosted deposits.

34,Paleochannel iron,"Paleochannel iron deposits are also known as Ferricretes, manganocretes. They belong to the general deposit group of Paleochannel deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Paleochannel iron deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, fluvial paleochannels, preexisting Fe, Mn mineralization, redox interface. Paleochannel iron deposits, also known as ferricretes or manganocretes, represent a specific class of mineral deposits formed in ancient river channels where significant mineralization processes occur due to the infiltration of surface waters into fluvial depositional environments. These deposits are primarily distinguished by their genesis in paleochannel settings, typically marked by the presence of preexisting iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) mineralizations that are subsequently altered by chemical weathering and groundwater movement. The ore bodies in these deposits generally consist of iron oxides such as hematite and goethite, often accompanied by manganese oxides, which precipitate at or near the redox interface where oxygenated waters interact with reduced subsurface conditions. This distinctive feature underpins their classification in an infiltrational deposit environment. The physiography usually involves old river terraces or plains where these paleochannels have been preserved as linear features in the landscape. The mineralization age can vary widely but often corresponds to periods of extensive weathering and erosion in stable tectonic settings. Ore grades can be highly variable; however, these deposits typically do not reach the high tonnage levels of more extensive banded iron formations or lateritic iron deposits. Structurally, paleochannel deposits are controlled by the morphology and sedimentary structures of the original fluvial system, modifying local hydrology and chemistry crucial in ore deposition. The uniqueness of paleochannel iron deposits lies in their formation process, involving surface water infiltration influencing pre-existing mineralization within discrete ancient channel systems, a trait not commonly observed in other deposit types.",Infiltrational,Paleochannel
35,Sandstone uranium,"Sandstone uranium deposits are also known as Roll front, and others. They belong to the general deposit group of Uranium deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Sandstone uranium deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, aquifers, preexisting volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks, redox interface. Sandstone uranium deposits, typified by the roll-front subtype, represent a unique sedimentary-hosted mineralization setting distinguished by the infiltration of oxidizing groundwaters through permeable sandstone units containing organic material or reductants such as pyrite. These deposits are typically formed in fluvial or marginal marine sedimentary rocks, often associated with interbedded shales and carbonaceous materials. Uranium in these systems is initially leached from volcanic ash layers or detrital heavy minerals within the sandstone by oxygenated surface waters. As these waters encounter reducing conditions at a redox front€”a boundary dictated by the presence of organic carbon or sulfides€”the uranium precipitates to form orebodies, often crescent-shaped in cross-section, known as roll-fronts. Commodity extraction focuses primarily on uranium oxides, such as uraninite, with ore grades significantly variable but generally averaging between 0.1% to 0.2% U3O8. Exploration indicators often include alteration halos of clay or bleached sandstone, and the presence of daughter minerals like coffinite. Tectonically, these deposits are prevalent in stable basins with minimal structural disruption, with mineralization ages varying widely from Proterozoic to Tertiary, depending on the basin evolution. The economic significance of these deposits lies not only in their uranium content but also in the relatively low cost of in-situ recovery techniques facilitated by the permeable nature of the host strata and the shallow depth of many orebodies.Sandstone uranium type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 30c.

36,Carbonate uranium,"Carbonate uranium deposits belong to the general deposit group of Uranium deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Carbonate uranium deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, aquifers, preexisting volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks, redox interface. Carbonate uranium deposits are distinctive mineral deposits characterized primarily by their formation in sedimentary environments where the infiltration of uranium-bearing surface waters through carbonate host rocks, such as limestones or dolostones, plays a critical role. These deposits often occur at redox interfaces where oxidizing conditions transition to reducing ones, facilitated by organic matter or pyrite, causing uranium to precipitate. The geological setting typically involves interbedded shales, sandstones, and volcanic ash layers which enhance uranium accumulation. The age of mineralization for these deposits is mostly Mesozoic to Cenozoic, aligning with periods of significant sedimentation and tectonic activity that create conducive physiographic and structural conditions for uranium entrapment. Ore bodies in carbonate uranium deposits are generally stratabound and peneconcordant, featuring roll-front, tabular, or lens-shaped geometries controlled by the host rock lithology and prevailing hydrogeological conditions. Furthermore, alteration zones showing decalcification or silicification around ore bodies are common, helping in localizing and concentrating ore. These deposits are noted for moderate to high uranium grades and can be of significant tonnage, offering viable mining opportunities. Distinguishing features of carbonate uranium deposits from other uranium deposit types include their unique host rocks, depositional environment, and the specific redox conditions necessary for ore formation. These factors not only influence the economic viability of mining projects but also contribute to the distinct geotechnical and environmental management challenges during ore extraction and processing.",Infiltrational,Uranium
37,Coal/peat/bog uranium,"Coal/peat/bog uranium deposits belong to the general deposit group of Uranium deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Coal/peat/bog uranium deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, aquifers, preexisting volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks, redox interface. Coal/peat/bog uranium deposits represent a distinctive class of uranium deposits, characterized primarily by their development within organic-rich sedimentary environments, such as coal seams, peat bogs, and associated sedimentary strata. These deposits are primarily formed through the infiltration of uranium-bearing surface waters into these organic-rich layers, where uranium precipitates at redox interfaces. The key geological features include the presence of lignite or sub-bituminous coal and other carbonaceous materials which serve as both a reductant and host for the uranium minerals. Uranium mineralization in these settings is often associated with clastic sedimentary rocks, commonly sandstones and siltstones, which may contain volcanic ash layers that contribute uranium to the system. The uranium ores typically display low to moderate grades but can accumulate significant tonnages due to the extensive nature of the sedimentary units involved.

These deposits are distinguished by their stratiform or stratabound orebodies and are often found in relatively flat-lying to gently dipping sedimentary basins, which influence the physiography of the region. The age of mineralization can vary widely, primarily depending on the age of the host sedimentary rocks, which can range from Paleozoic to Tertiary. Coal/peat/bog uranium deposits notably differ from other uranium deposit types, such as unconformity-related or intrusive-related deposits, by their association with sedimentary processes and organic material rather than tectonic or igneous activity. This sedimentary linkage dictates unique exploration and extraction techniques, focusing on hydrogeological and geochemical models to define the ore controls and predict deposit extents.",Infiltrational,Uranium
38,Calcrete uranium,"Calcrete uranium deposits are also known as Surficial uranium, evaporite uranium. They belong to the general deposit group of Uranium deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Calcrete uranium deposits include: Infiltration of surface water, aquifers, preexisting volcanic ash-bearing sedimentary rocks, lacustrine evaporite. Calcrete uranium deposits, distinct within the uranium deposit group due to their formation in superficial or near-surface environments, predominantly develop in arid to semi-arid regions where calcium carbonate accumulates to form calcrete€”a sedimentary rock derived from pedogenic and groundwater processes. These deposits are often hosted within or associated with unconsolidated or semi-consolidated sediments, particularly paleochannels and lacustrine evaporite basins where uranium, transported by oxidizing surface waters, precipitates from groundwater in response to changes in pH or by mixing with waters rich in bicarbonate. The key host rocks are typically calcretes, and other carbonates, accompanied sometimes by clays or silts that may contain fossilized plant material, aiding in ore concentration. Ore minerals mainly include uranium vanadates and carnotite, presenting yellowish hues. These deposits are relatively low-grade but can be extensive, supporting large-scale mining operations; grades commonly range from 0.01% to 0.20% U3O8, with the ore zones laterally extensive but generally shallow, rarely exceeding 20 meters in depth. What sets calcrete uranium deposits apart is the minimal geological disturbance required for their formation, relying heavily on climatic and hydrological stability to facilitate uranium precipitation and concentration in a specific stratigraphic level or geomorphological setting, without the need for significant tectonic or magmatic input that characterizes many other uranium deposit types.",Infiltrational,Uranium
39,Nodular magnesite,"Nodular magnesite deposits are also known as Cryptocrystalline magnesite. They belong to the general deposit group of Magnesite deposits. The deposit environment is typically Infiltrational. Genetically related features of typical Nodular magnesite deposits include: Infiltration of CO2-bearing surface water into fractured ultramafic rocks. Nodular magnesite deposits, also known as cryptocrystalline magnesite, are distinctive mineral deposits typically forming within ultramafic rock complexes through infiltration processes. Geologically, these deposits are characterized by the penetration of carbon dioxide-rich surface waters into fractured serpentine-rich ultramafic rocks which leads to the precipitation of magnesite (MgCO3). These nodules are often small, ranging from millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter, and are emplaced within the host rock or soil matrices. The magnesite in these deposits generally features high purity levels with lower contents of iron and silica compared to other magnesite types. Such settings are not necessarily associated with specific age constraints, as the process is more about current or recent geologic and hydrologic conditions than about a particular geologic era. The formation environments are typically situated in regions marked by past or ongoing tectonic activity which have created the necessary fractures and provided pathways for fluid movement. These deposits are often formed in relatively cooler and shallower crustal levels compared to other deposit types, highlighting a low-temperature genesis. The typical physiographic settings include mountainous or hilly terrains where ultramafic rocks are exposed.

Genetically related features of typical Marine evaporite gypsum deposits include: Silled marine basin, arid climate, pinnacle reefs, evaporites, sabkha dolomites. Marine evaporite gypsum deposits are a distinct type of mineral deposit formed in environments characterized by high evaporation rates, typically within silled marine basins under arid climatic conditions. These deposits are composed primarily of gypsum, along with associated minerals such as halite and anhydrite, forming extensive layered sequences that reflect periodic saline water influx and evaporation. The depositional settings are generally flat, expansive basins often associated with sabkha environments and dolomitized zones around the margins, such as sabkha dolomites and pinnacle reefs, which are critical in distinguishing these deposits from non-marine evaporites. The age of these deposits can vary widely but they are prevalent in both modern settings and throughout the geological record, particularly prominent in Permian and Triassic periods. The physiographical setup typically involves shallow, enclosed basinal areas that facilitate the precipitation of sulfate minerals due to prolonged periods of water evaporation. Ore bodies are usually stratiform, extensive, and flat-lying, lacking significant alteration effects due to the mechanical, rather than chemical, nature of the deposit formation. In terms of economic significance, these deposits are primarily mined for gypsum, used in construction, and occasionally for halite (rock salt). The purity of gypsum can be high, making these deposits economically attractive. Tectonic settings are usually stable, within platforms or slightly subsiding basins with limited influence from orogenic activity, thereby preserving the evaporite sequences from significant deformation. The uniqueness of marine evaporite gypsum deposits lies in their formation environment, mineral purity, and stratigraphy, distinctively differentiated from other mineral deposits primarily by their evaporative, marine origin and sedimentological characteristics.Marine evaporite gypsum type mineral deposits are also known as USGS deposit model number 35ae.

Genetically related features of typical Marine evaporite salt deposits include: Silled marine basin, arid climate, pinnacle reefs, evaporites, sabkha dolomites. Marine evaporite salt deposits, characteristic of silled marine basins under arid climates, represent a unique class within the broader group of evaporite deposits. These deposits primarily consist of halite and other evaporitic minerals such as gypsum and anhydrite, formed through the precipitation from evaporating seawater. The geological setting typically involves shallow, restricted basins where water circulation is limited by barriers like sills, promoting excessive evaporation. Commodity-wise, marine evaporite salts are chiefly exploited for sodium chloride (table salt), with potash (potassium chloride) and magnesium salts also being significant. These minerals are crucial in various industries, ranging from culinary uses to agricultural and industrial applications. The deposits typically show extensive areas filled with thick salt beds, often associated with interbedded clastic sediments, carbonates, and reef structures like pinnacle reefs. The age of these deposits can range widely, with significant formations occurring from the Cambrian to the Tertiary periods.

Genetically related features of typical MVT strontium deposits include: Contractional orogeny, foreland basin, forebulge faults, arid climate, evaporites, basin brine, alkali and magnesium metasomatism. Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) strontium deposits embody a subset of hydrothermal mineral systems primarily embedded in sedimentary rock sequences within stable cratonic settings, with significant formation linked to the sequelae of orogenic foreland basin dynamics. These deposits are typically found associated with carbonate rocks, frequently dolostones and limestones, where strontium (Sr) replaces the calcium (Ca) within the carbonate minerals. This substitution mainly occurs in a basin environment influenced by evaporitic conditions, promoting the migration of metal-saturated brines. MVT deposits are distinct in their widespread occurrence away from magmatic activity, relying instead on the mobilization of metals from thick sequences of sedimentary rocks triggered by basin-wide fluids driven by tectonic compaction or distant orogenic events. A key feature includes the deposit€™s confinement to specific structural settings such as platform-margin faults and anticlines, which act as conduits and traps for mineral-bearing solutions. Unlike many other types of deposits, MVT deposits, including those bearing strontium, do not display a direct connection to volcanic activity, distinguishing them from deposits like skarns or VMS that necessitate proximate magmatic influences. The strontium typically precipitates out of solution when these brines encounter reactive host rocks or diluting meteoric waters, forming relatively high-grade ore bodies. These deposits are also characterized by minimal host rock alteration, with the ore localized by structural and stratigraphic controls rather than pervasive alteration zones. This, coupled with their geological setting, typically results in strontium deposits that exhibit a sporadic geographical distribution, with occurrences often stratigraphically constrained and extending over large lateral distances but thin in vertical accumulation.",Basin hydrothermal,Mississippi Valley-type (MVT)

Genetically related features of typical Porphyry tungsten deposits include: Continental arc, back arc, or hinterland, felsic magmatism of ilmenite series, calc-alkaline volcano-plutonic center, magmatic fluid, alkali and hydrolytic metasomatism. Porphyry tungsten deposits, a subtype of the broader porphyry deposit family, are primarily formed within continental arc, back arc, or hinterland settings where felsic magmatism of the ilmenite series predominates within calc-alkaline volcano-plutonic centers. Characteristic of these deposits is the association with large-scale, high-level intrusive complexes that drive the magmatic-hydrothermal systems essential for mineralization. These systems introduce magmatic fluids that interact extensively with the surrounding rock, causing alkali and hydrolytic metasomatism that results in extensive alteration halos. Typically, the alteration minerals include potassium feldspar, biotite, and quartz, often accompanied by greisenization€”a process indicative of substantial tungsten mineralization. Ore minerals predominantly comprise scheelite (CaWO4) and lesser wolframite (Fe,Mn)WO4, forming in veinlet-disseminated or stockwork orebodies. Compared to other porphyry deposits like those of copper or molybdenum, porphyry tungsten deposits exhibit lower overall tonnage but can show appreciable grades of tungsten, vital for high-tech and industrial applications. The age of mineralization usually correlates with the timing of magmatic activity, which, in these deposits, can range widely from the Paleozoic to the Cenozoic, reflecting the long-lived nature of continental magmatic arcs. Tectonically, these deposits are tied to subduction-related processes or crustal extension settings, where the juxtaposition of different crustal blocks and associated fault systems provides pathways for fluid flow and ore deposition.
